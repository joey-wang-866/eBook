As TMC turns five, we celebrate not only this moment, but also prepare to welcome the sonic landscapes of the future.Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Music010011Live Pop Music Through the Lens","Building a Home for Taiwanese Pop Music: The Origin of TMCThe Taipei Music Center (TMC) officially opened its doors in 2020, with Kay Huang appointed as its first chairperson. Three years later, she was reappointed to continue in the post. From creator, producer, and performer to the head of a legal entity, Huang initially declined the position twice. But on the third invitation, as she looked into an uncertain future, a thought struck her: \u201cIf no one is willing to do this, let me give it a try. I want to see what I can bring to TMC as a musician.\u201dA Musician Steps UpIn the past, as a musician, her focus was solely on creation. Now, as chairperson of TMC, Huang carries the weight of an entire organization, responsible for everything that happens within it. After accepting the position, she extended the mindset of producing music into managing an institution. She introduced the guiding spirit of \u201cMove Closer to the Future, Respect the Future, Into the Future\u201d to shape the missions of TMC\u2019s three core venues: the Concert Hall, Cultural Cube, and Creative Hub, each designed to support musicians and their development.Just as producing an album requires thinking through every detail, running TMC demands envisioning all the possibilities ahead. Whenever she encountered unfamiliar territory, she would jot down names of people to consult. \u201cYou need to know who to ask,\u201d she says, \u201cand how to ask for help. Seeking help isn\u2019t about retreating; it\u2019s about moving forward.\u201dAs an administrative legal entity, TMC bears major responsibilities entrusted by the Taipei City Government, from managing performance venues to supporting the broader pop music industry. Most of these were areas Huang had never dealt with before. To bridge those gaps, she turned to the very people who helped bring TMC into being, as well as senior figures in Taiwan\u2019s cultural world, such as Yu-Chiou Tchen, Tzong-Ching Ju , Jing-Jyi Wu, Jonathan Lee, and Wu Nien-Jen. When new challenges arose, she drew on her network to find connections, working step by step to gather the momentum needed to propel TMC forward.\u201cPop Music Needs a Home\u201dWhat left the deepest impression on Chairperson Huang was a proposal made over twenty years ago by former Minister of the Council for Cultural Affairs, Yu-Chiou Tchen: that both northern and southern Taiwan should each have a pop music center, to build a home for Taiwanese pop music. \u201cThe idea that \u2018pop music needs a home\u2019 took root in my heart,\u201d Huang recalls.Tchen left Taiwan to study in France at the age of sixteen. She recalls, \u201cBack then, the Eurovision Song Contest was a televised event broadcast across all of Europe. The entire continent was electrified, France included. People of all ages were completely captivated.\u201d That experience left a deep impression on her and planted the idea that pop music should belong to the people.After returning to Taiwan in 1975 to begin teaching, Tchen began researching pop music. She believed that Taiwan possessed a wealth of solid creative content and had long played a vital role in the Mandarin pop music world. It was only fitting, she felt, that Taiwan should have its own dedicated pop music center. In 2000, she was appointed Minister of the Council for Cultural Affairs. Reflecting on that time, she says, \u201cI happened to be in a position where I had both the authority and the opportunity to help creators, performers, and fans realize their dream. So I turned to Johnny Tuan ChungYi and Chang Pei-Zen at Rock Records, they worked with me to draft policies and shape the proposal. In 2002, I submitted the proposal to the Executive Yuan, and it was incorporated into the government's \u2018New Ten Major Construction Projects.\u2019 At the time, my hope was that every region in Taiwan could one day have a modern arts center of international caliber.\u201dAt the suggestion of Johnny Tuan Chung-Yi, the concept of establishing pop music centers in both northern and southern Taiwan drew inspiration from the Museum of Pop Culture No city gains its music venue overnight. TMC was born through the efforts of policymakers, industry professionals, educators, and artists, each carrying the torch in turn to build a space where Taiwanese pop music could be understood and allowed to flourish. From the birth of the idea to the formation of systems, from the rise of the architecture to five years of active programming, we now look back on this journey. It was the dream of a generation, and the city\u2019s answer to music and to the times.Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Music012013","presses deep admiration for her dedication over the past five years. \u201cShe\u2019s willingly poured her decades of industry experience, networks, and expertise into the operations of TMC, and that\u2019s truly rare.\u201dJu affirms that in addition to fulfilling its public mandate from the Taipei City Government, TMC has also actively pursued market-oriented initiatives. From passing down experience and cultivating talent to fostering industry exchange, the center has demonstrated a strong sense of mission.He believes TMC will continue to drive growth across the content industry, not only as a training ground for future professionals, but also as a vital cultural symbol for the city of Taipei.Huang responded by expressing her gratitude for the strong, long-term support from the Ministry of Culture and the Taipei City Government. As the first local administrative legal entity dedicated to advancing the pop music industry, TMC has benefited greatly from this backing. Today, TMC and the Taipei City Department of Cultural Affairs operate in a partnership-like relationship. Commissioner Shih-Ping Tsai explained that the Department is responsible for shaping overall cultural policy, while TMC plays the role of implementing and deepening that policy. Take the \u201cTRENDY TAIPEI\u201d campaign launched in 2024 for example: TMC curated a series of programs under the \u201cTAIPEI MUSIC EXPO,\u201d which aligned with three core themes, industry forums, concert-driven economic, and city-wide engagement. Tsai added that in planning the content of these events, the department relied heavily on the professional expertise of the TMC team: \u201cIn my discussions with the TMC team, I gained a great deal of insight into the inner workings of the industry.\u201dIn 2025, with all of TMC\u2019s venues officially in operation, Tsai witnessed firsthand how the concert economy was breathing new energy and momentum into the city. He recently attended a concert by Anna Lin, who rose to fame more than thirty years ago with the hit song Silent Ending. The performance drew a large crowd of longtime fans. As the show ended, another wave of concertgoers, mostly younger listeners, was spilling out from a separate venue where \u00d8ZI had just wrapped up his own performance.\u201cThe image of two generations brought together by music in the same space moved me deeply.\u201d Tsai said. \u201cTMC isn\u2019t just preserving music history; it\u2019s also nurturing the next generation. With performance spaces of different sizes and scales, Taipei\u2019s live concert ecosystem is finally connecting. That moment was truly a beautiful one.\u201dRepositioning Pop Music and Bridging GenerationsAt the founding of TMC, Chairperson Huang sought the guidance of Dr. Jing-Jyi Wu, a key figure in Taiwan\u2019s theater scene. Wu pointed out that Taiwan once held a pivotal position in the Mandarin pop music market, and that maintaining this influence would require internationalization. He shared his own observations on cultural trends: \u201cThe concept of globalization is increasingly being questioned (MoPOP) in Seattle. Founded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen as a tribute to his hometown and its legendary musical hero Jimi Hendrix, MoPOP integrates the city\u2019s tech industry and artistic culture into an experiential soundbased architectural landmark. Tchen believed that Taiwan, too, offered a unique environment where digital innovation and culture could go hand in hand. Her vision, therefore, was to make the pop music center a joyful, avant-garde space for experimentation.She adds, \u201cThe pop music performance center I envisioned would establish an industry chain between digital art and pop music, while also fulfilling educational and experiential roles. I hoped that through public engagement, awareness, and learning, we could foster an ecosystem.\u201d This vision aligned closely with the direction TMC would eventually take. In 2025, one of the center\u2019s venues will officially be designated an innovation hub, dedicated to cross-disciplinary experimentation at the intersection of music and technology, actively expanding the possibilities for diverse performances and industry applications.Looking back on the past five years, Tchen speaks highly of Huang\u2019s leadership: \u201cShe is a creator herself, full of ideas, yet pragmatic and humble in her learning. I believe she will continue to accomplish even more and lead TMC into a glorious future.\u201dFrom Inception to Industry AnchorContinuing along the path first laid out by Tchen in the founding of TMC, Ju Tzong-Ching, former director of the National Performing Arts Center and founder of the Ju Percussion Group, witnessed how TMC gradually took shape within Taiwan\u2019s policy framework. He has a clear understanding of the expectations placed on TMC: that it should become a leader in pop music, using the distinct positioning of its venues to generate a magnetic pull, concentrate creative energy, and in turn, drive the development of the broader industry.As one of the key advocates behind the administrative legal entity policy, Ju held frequent discussions with Huang. He believes the administrative legal entity is an idealistic and forward-looking system, one that allows institutions tasked with national public missions to strengthen their professionalism and competitiveness by loosening restrictions on personnel and accounting structures.Still, Ju acknowledges that implementing this system in Taiwan inevitably comes with challenges. Based on past experience, he notes that public understanding of the legal entity framework remains limited, while policy support is often incomplete or inconsistent. Combined with a societal tendency to oversimplify complex issues, these factors create significant obstacles when trying to put the system into practice. \u201cThe key to success isn\u2019t how long the preparation takes, it\u2019s the quality of communication,\u201d Ju explains. \u201cAnd managing people requires real effort. Whether there\u2019s genuine resolve to promote the legal entity model often hinges on that.\u201dHaving known Huang for many years, Ju exSense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Music014015","today, but that only highlights a deeper truth: the more deeply rooted something is in its local culture, the more likely it is to gain global visibility. In recent years, the works that have gained international attention are often those born of the land, grounded in lived experience, like the musical Don't Cry, Dancing Girls, the choreography of Bulareyaung Pagarlava, or the story of Difang Tuwana. These works have made the world hear our voices.\u201dBut before moving toward internationalization, Taiwanese pop music must first rediscover its own identity. \u201cAt different stages of life, every person has to reposition themselves, and so do teams and organizations.\u201d Wu said. He emphasized that pop music has always been inherently tied to generational experience. As society changes rapidly, pop music must evolve with it, and reexamine its relationship to the nation, to society, and to its people. Wu emphasized, \u201cWe can\u2019t just indulge in self-appreciation, we have to stay connected to the world. Truly great music doesn\u2019t need aggressive promotion; it will cut through borders and resonate on its own. When I speak of \u2018repositioning,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean simply reclaiming the past, I mean redefining the value of our music. What is Taiwanese music? How does it shape our lives?\u201dThis process of repositioning will help TMC gain a clearer understanding of its mission. He hopes TMC will remain committed to discovering, nurturing, and promoting talent in contemporary music, ensuring that the spirit of pop music continues to pass from one generation to the next, and that Taiwan continues to generate vibrant cultural energy for the future.Eyes and Ears to the WorldVeteran singer-songwriter Jonathan Lee, affectionately known in the music community as \u201cBig Brother,\u201d holds a different vision for TMC. Speaking from a musician\u2019s perspective, he believes that TMC should be a space that serves musicians, and more importantly, a window that helps them see and reach the world. \u201cI think TMC should be the eyes and ears through which musicians in northern Taiwan view the world,\u201d he said.Echoing Huang\u2019s description of TMC as a kind of \u201ccommunity center for pop music,\u201d Lee emphasized: \u201cTMC\u2019s mission is to serve, and to help musicians develop a global perspective. If we want the world to see Taiwan through artistic creation, then pop music is our most visible channel. The nation, government, and cultural institutions must recognize this advantage and make the most of it.\u201dLike Jing-Jyi Wu, Lee firmly believes that Taiwanese pop music must move onto the international stage. He also hopes that Taiwanese musicians will take a more active role in connecting with the world: \u201cThere\u2019s so much music out there, so many different kinds. Just recently, I came across some artists who are really alternative, really inspiring. TMC should be going out to find people like that and digging deeper into their work.\u201d He went on to emphasize: \u201cIn terms of international exchange, we need to understand how music industries operate in other countries. How does an unknown band grow to the point where they can play in a live house? How does their management system work? What does their industry hierarchy look like? There\u2019s so much in those systems and practices that we can study and learn from.\u201dReflecting on the time when Huang first took on the role of chairperson, Lee admitted he had his doubts: \u201cI remember when she was about to take the job, I was honestly a little worried. I thought, why is this little sister of mine jumping into something like that?\u201d He paused, then added with a smile and a trace of affection: \u201cBut it\u2019s already been five years. So many people have come and gone through TMC, and she\u2019s still here.\u201dBurning and ShiningAnother respected \u201cBig Brother\u201d figure, director Wu Nien-Jen, also felt a pang of concern when he heard that Huang was about to take on the role of chairperson. \u201cAsking a music creator to deal with city government and city council, it felt like watching a little white rabbit walk into the jungle,\u201d he said.Having known Huang for many years, he initially worried that her freedom and creativity as an artist might be constrained by the demands of the role. But more than that, he believed in the quiet resilience and strength she carried beneath the surface. Over the past five years, Wu has witnessed the transformation of TMC, and how more and more musicians have begun to gather in the area around it, opening shops, studios, and live houses. \u201cBringing like-minded people together in one place, working side by side, building something together, that\u2019s what I call burning, that\u2019s what I call shining. We can\u2019t predict what will come of it in the end. But as long as people gather with passion, and are willing to truly invest in this place, then no matter what happens, it will leave a mark.\u201dThe scene reminded Wu Nien-Jen of the joyful days of his youth. \u201cLooking back now, I think the happiest time in my life was those ten years making films. No matter what came our way, it was always about a group of people doing it together, charging ahead as one. And now, when I look back, I realize we actually created something, and it feels like we truly changed something.\u201dLike Jing-Jyi Wu and Jonathan Lee, Wu Nien-Jen also hopes TMC will become a stronghold for creators and performers. Now in his seventies, he has come to an important realization: \u201cWhen we\u2019re young, we always hope to see cultural results right away. But in truth, no cultural legacy can blossom in just two or three years. You have to take a long view to understand what those efforts have really accomplished.\u201dAnd that is precisely why, on the occasion of its fifth anniversary, TMC has chosen to publish this book, to look back on the path it has taken over the past five years, and to invite readers to immerse themselves. Open your senses. Follow the words. Trace the journey of TMC and Taiwan\u2019s music industry, and together, imagine what the future of Taiwanese pop music might become.Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Music016017","Melodies M a d e TangibleM e lodies Made TangibleMusic is more than just sound. Through physical formats like records and cassette tapes, it can be collected, flipped through, and woven into daily life as visible and touchable memory. In\u201cMUSIC, ISLAND, STORIES: Pop Music in Taiwan,\u201dthe curatorial team draws on tangible objects and period settings to make melodies not only audible but also visible. From musicians' guitars and handwritten recording notes to yellowed setlists and stage costumes, each item stands as evidence of pop music's presence. Formats once considered\u201cold-school,\u201dlike cassettes and vinyl, are now experiencing a vibrant revival. Through free design language, album packaging transforms sound into images and objects, becoming vessels of cross-generational preservation and reinvention. Let us begin with Melodies \u201cMade Tangible,\u201dtracing memory through material forms, witnessing the marks pop music has left behind, and seeing how it continues to resonate across generations, reopened and cherished anew today.Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Music1018019","Giving Form to the Melodies of Memory:Inside \u201cMUSIC, ISLAND, STORIES: Pop Music in Taiwan\u201d and the Evolution of Taiwanese Pop MusicIn the digital age, music feels increasingly intangible. We stream it, store it in the cloud, and gradually drift away from the physical experience of sound. That\u2019s precisely why rediscovering music\u2019s texture, its presence in objects, and its connection to memory has become a vital way to explore and immerse ourselves in Taiwanese pop music. TMC\u2019s permanent exhibition, \u201cMUSIC, ISLAND, STORIES: Pop Music in Taiwan,\u201d offers a tangible space for that experience. Through curatorial methods that interweave physical artifacts with period settings, the exhibition is not only a retrospective of sound but also an experiment in making pop music visible. From this point of departure, we trace the development of Taiwanese pop, reflecting on the marks it has left and exploring how it continues to resonate with us today.\u201cMUSIC, ISLAND, STORIES: Pop Music in Taiwan\u201d is led by INCEPTION\u2019s CEO and curator Ocean Liang, and co-curated by music critic Shih-Fang Ma , musician Masa, and designer Akibo. Drawing from tens of thousands of Taiwanese pop songs and their remaining \u201cphysical traces,\u201d the team reconstructed a visible, tangible, and audible path through Taiwan\u2019s pop music history.The exhibition spans from the fourth to the sixth floor of TMC\u2019s Cultural Cube, comprising thirteen sections, nineteen narrators, and 113 featured songs. It showcases over 1,400 displays, from yellowing manuscripts, iconic vinyl records, to cassette tapes to pianos, guitars, and stage installations. Using physical objects and immersive scenes as narrative tools, the curatorial team guides visitors across generations, from the tangible to the intangible, so that each song becomes not only a memory but a visual landscape unfolding before the eyes.This exhibition about sound is also an effort to make music seen, discussed, and cherished once again. Since opening in September 2021, it has served as the permanent exhibition of TMC\u2019s Cultural Cube and an essential starting point for introducing pop music to the public.Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Music020021Melodies Made Tangible ","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Music\u201cThis isn\u2019t a history lesson, but a musical journey, carefully arranged like a composition,\u201d says co-curator Shih-Fang Ma .Recreating the Magic of Music Through Iconic ScenesTo help visitors truly experience the era when music existed in physical form, the curatorial team intentionally avoided a traditional chronological approach. Instead, they structured the exhibition around distinct \u201cscenes:\u201d each space begins with a theme, and only then is the song list determined. Every gallery recreates a specific setting from a particular era: stepping inside is like walking into a shared memory, where the melodies of that time can be heard. For Masa, one of the greatest challenges was finding a way to make pop music, an art form rooted in listening, into something that could be \u201cseen.\u201d \u201cListening to music is a deeply personal and intimate experience,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter how you frame it, audiences will respond differently based on their own tastes and emotional attachments.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s also what makes pop music so moving. At some point in our lives, it plays a role that nothing else can replace.\u201dThe exhibition opens with \u201cMemories in Music,\u201d where Chen Da\u2019s yueqin is placed alongside Wu Bai\u2019s electric guitar, allowing Su Siang Ki and rock music to stand side by side, symbolizing the overlapping of cross-generational sounds. In the \u201cTaipei Circle\u201d gallery, projection mapping recreates the famous roundabout by day and night, taking visitors through a journey of formats, from Japanese colonial-era k\u00f3a\u00e1-pun (songbooks), radios, and gramophones to record shops and cassette tapes. The next space, \u201cThe Electrical Appliance Store,\u201d features a recreated storefront window filled with vintage TVs, cassette walkmans, and portable tape recorders, like drawers of memory being opened one by one.Instead of following a traditional chronological sequence, the curatorial team invites visitors to step into immersive settings from different eras and hear the music of each time and place. From left to right: exhibition rooms\u201cTaipei Circle,\u201d \u201cThe Electrical Appliance Store,\u201d and \u201cThe Train.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to move people with music. What\u2019s hard is awakening someone\u2019s personal memory of a specific song.\u201d Masa said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t know the song well, if you heard it at any point growing up, when that melody plays, the memories come flooding back.\u201dAmplifying Emotion: Songs Enhanced Through ImagesMeanwhile, Akibo used projection technology to create immersive environments that merge visual and auditory elements, allowing visitors to step into the emotional landscapes of different eras.The gallery \u201cThe Train\u201d takes the image of a moving train carriage to evoke the emotions of leaving home. Songs by Lim Giong and Lo Ta-You sing of searching and longing, while scenes rolling past the train window reflect Taiwan\u2019s transition, from an agricultural society to industrialization and into modernity.In \u201cYoung People\u2019s Spiritual Sanctuary,\u201d the curatorial team uses projection to depict a room in constant flux. As the arrangement of the space and the language of lighting shift, the room reflects a continuum of songs with attitude, beginning with those composed during the political loosening of the 1980s and extending to the voices of Tom Chang, Cheer Chen, Jay Chou, Yueting Song, and No Party For Cao Dong. Within this space, the concerns of young people across generations are layered and brought to light.\u201cEven visitors who aren\u2019t familiar with the music can walk away with a basic sense of Taiwanese pop,\u201d said Shih-Fang Ma . He believes the pairing of image and song heightens emotional intensity, allowing audiences to feel the creative power and resonance of pop music within its historical context, without needing any prior historical knowledge.Enhancing The Power of Emotion through Tangible ObjectsIn the exhibition zones \u201cThe Allure of Music\u201d and \u201cLive Music and Festivals,\u201d the power of physical objects is brought vividly to life. Masa, who has visited music exhibitions around the world, recalls a powerful moment at The Beatles Story museum in the UK: \u201cNo amount of old photographs or album covers could compare to the impact of seeing John Lennon\u2019s actual guitar on display. Right beside it were his manuscripts, notes, and that pair of broken round glasses.\u201d To see a meaningful song captured in handwritten form is a moment of real emotional weight for fans.Ma agrees. He notes that even just sitting quietly in their cases, these objects possess incredible 022023Melodies Made Tangible ","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Musicpresence. Take, for example, Tom Chang\u2019s guitar, Lo Ta-You\u2019s sunglasses, or the mixing console once used by arranger Chen Chih-Yuan at Platinum Studio. Their convergence not only gives the exhibition a tangible physicality but also offers visitors an emotional anchor, something concrete to carry forward after journeying through the eras of music on display.Highlighting Hip-Hop\u2019s Contemporary Soundscape: The Musical Narrative ContinuesAs the exhibition entered its third year, a new section was added to the permanent exhibition at the end of 2023: \u201cHIP-HOP Event Taiwan Hip-Hop.\u201d \u201cPop music is always changing, so the content of the exhibition must change as well.\u201d said Masa.Ma noted that hip-hop has become one of the most energetic voices in Taiwan\u2019s recent original music scene. \u201cHip-hop places great importance on lyrics and engages directly with contemporary issues. In terms of linguistic rhythm and thematic expression, Taiwan\u2019s hiphop is already very mature.\u201d For the curatorial team, including hip-hop in the exhibition at this moment is a response to musical developments, but also a way to mark this point in the timeline. Masa added, \u201cWe want people to notice that hip-hop is growing, it represents the language and ideas of the younger generation. It\u2019s not just the latest trend in pop music; it\u2019s already become a way of life.\u201dThe permanent exhibition takes the year 2000 as a dividing line. Over the past twenty-five years, listening habits have undergone changes entirely different from those of earlier generations. The two curators observed that as musical tastes become more fragmented, younger audiences are increasingly turning to older songs. Masa shared an insight from his experience with KKBOX\u2019s \u201cOpen Deck\u201d project: \u201cSongs from twenty or thirty years ago are generating more resonance than those released in the past five years.\u201d And most of the three to four hundred audience members singing along beneath the stage were in their twenties or thirties.Ma added that many songs released in earlier decades continue to receive high streaming numbers and are frequently adapted as theme songs for film and television. For new generations of creators and listeners, re-understanding and reinterpreting \u201cthe voices of the previous generation\u201d has become a kind of unspoken prerequisite for entering the music scene. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to understand newly created works and current trends; you also need to understand how those past sounds are being recreated today,\u201d said Ma, who now teaches at a university.Amid these shifting trends and circulating memories, \u201cMUSIC, ISLAND, STORIES: Pop Music in Taiwan\u201d brings those once-familiar voices back into view through tangible form. Masa smiled and said, \u201cWe hope the insiders will catch the nuances, and that even those less familiar can still enjoy the spectacle.\u201d Whatever your reason for entering the exhibition, somewhere among the album covers, manuscripts, instruments, and lighting, you\u2019ll likely have a moment of realization, of truly \u201cseeing\u201d music made tangible. And from that moment on, the experience of pop music will no longer be something purely intangible.The \u201cHIP-HOP Event Taiwan Hip-Hop\u201d section brings together rap artists from different generations to share their personal experiences and reflect on the intersections between hip-hop and generational culture. On display are handwritten lyrics, rare videotapes, and other archival treasures that trace the evolution of hip-hop in Taiwan.024025Melodies Made Tangible ","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicBefore the rise of streaming, music was shared and enjoyed through analog formats: vinyl records became widespread in the 1960s, followed by cassette tapes and CDs in the 1970s and 1980s. In the late 1990s, MP3s and the internet began changing how people listened to music, and by the late 2000s, platforms like Spotify ushered in the streaming era. In just six or seven decades, the shift from vinyl to streaming has reshaped the entire industry. Yet physical formats haven\u2019t vanished; they\u2019ve taken on new meaning and continue to play a role in today\u2019s musical landscape. What kind of future awaits music in physical form? Tsan-Pin Yu, founder of Kind of Blue Records, and Jim Chang, founder of Datao Vinyl, share their thoughts on the enduring power and potential of music in physical form.Not Just Retro:Speaking about how vinyl and cassette buyers have changed over the decades, Jim Chang is direct: \u201cThey\u2019re completely different!\u201d When he opened his first shop in 2009, most visitors were focused on secondhand classics: classical music, jazz, and old rock albums. These customers were generally older, already equipped with high-quality vinyl sound systems at home. They were used to listening before buying, handling the records to check audio quality and condition, and carefully reading every detail on the sleeves; they were particular about the recording versions.The Revival of Physical Music - From Analog Formats to Listening Rituals, Redefining What It Means to \u201cOwn\u201d MusicTsan-Pin YuJim ChangFounder of Kind of Blue Records, a shop dedicated to cassette tapes.

In 2022, he brought his shop to TMC, continuing his mission to promote physical music.026027Melodies Made Tangible ","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicCaptionsToday\u2019s customers are a different story. Many are first drawn to vinyl by the weight and appeal of the cover design, or because their favorite artists have released albums on vinyl. They may not even own a player at first, and records are initially purchased as decorative objects or collectibles. Only after their collection grows do they start searching for a turntable, gradually building out a fuller experience around the hobby.\u201cWhen you have just one vinyl or cassette, you might just admire it from afar. With five, you\u2019ll start thinking about getting a player. And by the time you own ten, you\u2019ll definitely go out and buy one,\u201d says Tsan-Pin Yu with a laugh. That\u2019s the entry point he often shares when introducing people to the world of physical tapes.How Cassette Tapes Returned: From Nostalgic Artifacts to Creative MediumsCompared to vinyl, the cassette tape revival came a little later. Tsan-Pin Yu recalls that the idea to center his brand around cassettes was first sparked by a news story he saw about the format\u2019s resurgence in Japan. For someone always eager to explore the possibilities of physical music formats, the story planted a seed in his mind.When he later decided to start his own business, that idea resurfaced. \u201cSince no one in Taiwan was promoting cassettes yet, I thought: why not give it a shot?\u201d he reFor those who didn\u2019t grow up with physical albums, music has always appeared flat. So it\u2019s genuinely moving when they suddenly see a three-dimensional album right in front of them.Tsan-Pin Yucalls. At first, unsure how the market would respond, he assumed the main customers would be those nostalgic for the cassette era. So his shop primarily carried secondhand tapes.It wasn\u2019t until a visit to a cassette specialty store in Tokyo that his perspective shifted. The owner said, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just stay in the past; we should promote new cassettes.\u201d That statement left a deep impression. Tsan-Pin Yu began importing newly released tapes and even produced a commemorative cassette album for Kind of Blue Records\u2019 anniversary event.Looking back, he\u2019s grateful for that decision. He has observed that in addition to older listeners who had lived through the vinyl and 028029Melodies Made Tangible ","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Musiccassette eras, many younger people are drawn to cassettes for their small, charming appearance, curious to hear what they sound like. For this group, old music might not hold much appeal, but a cassette from an artist they already know and love is often the hook that gets them interested. Cassettes have returned to the music scene not just because of nostalgia, but because they\u2019ve started to carry new creations. This shift is what has allowed a seemingly retro format to reenter the contemporary music landscape.The Tangibility of Ownership in MusicAs more and more young people come into contact with vinyl records and cassette tapes, one can\u2019t help but wonder: why is physical music becoming popular once more?Jim Chang believes it may be because young people have never really experienced what it means to \u201cown music.\u201d He recalls what first drew him into the world of vinyl: on one hand, it was having access to quality audio equipment, which encouraged a more discerning approach to listening; on the other, it was the simple joy of \u201cowning\u201d an album.For digital natives, music is intangible, something borrowed from the cloud. Listening to physical formats becomes a novel experience. With social media amplifying trends, whenever a celebrity or influencer shares their vinyl collection, it often sparks waves of imitation and prompts more artists to release physical merchandise.Jim Chang emphasizes that the value of physical music lies not just in the object itself, but in how it invites listeners to experience the album as the artist intended, from the emotional arc to the context of the whole work. The lyric booklet can be flipped through, and the names of songwriters and composers become visible; \u201cthe full weight of a singer\u2019s effort is carried in it.\u201dIn contrast, listeners on streaming platforms often consume music one song at a time, making it harder to grasp the complete structure or concept behind a work. For many artists, then, a physical album isn\u2019t just a product; it\u2019s a work of art meant to be understood and cherished. It allows the music not only to be heard, but also to bring the listener closer to the music.The Evolving Role of Physical Music in the New EraRecord stores were once key hubs of pop culture and gathering spots for music lovers. While physical stores may now seem in decline, they have gained a new kind of emotional resonance. Tsan-Pin Yu recalls how, when Mayday held a concert in Taichung, fans flocked to his store after a social media post revealed that it carried the band\u2019s cassette tapes. Some came to request songs, some to warm up before the show, and others to relive the concert\u2019s atmosphere. At a pop-up event in Hong Kong, his full collection of Leslie Cheung cassette tapes drew fans of all ages, turning the store into an impromptu gathering for the late star\u2019s admirers. These experiences made him realize that record stores are no longer just places to buy music.At the same time, cassettes, CDs, and vinyl records are being used in more diverse contexts. Tsan-Pin Yu notes that some artists repurpose blank cassettes as performance props, looping recordings live onstage and turning the format itself into a creative tool.Jim Chang has observed a growing trend of using physical media as elements of atmosphere, appearing in hotels, barber shops, and caf\u00e9s. Simply placing a tape deck or record player in a space can conjure a sense of time and texture. He laughs that the changes have outpaced anything he could have imagined, but he\u2019s trying to keep up. He has also discovered how more and more young people are engaging with music not for sound quality or nostalgia, but simply to find their own way of connecting with it. These formats are no longer just containers for music. They\u2019ve become expressive tools for a new generation, acts of choice, and acts of self-expression.A physical album carries the full effort of an artist. Through its cover, lyrics, and track list, fans can truly engage with the album. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m so passionate about promoting vinyl.\u2014Jim Chang030031Melodies Made Tangible ","Melodies Made Tangible Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicTaiwan\u2019s first Grammy Award trophy and the winning album Pakelang are on a limited-time display at TMC\u2019s Cultural Cube.As early as 2005, graphic designer Xiao QingYang rose to the international stage as the first Taiwanese artist ever nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. A trailblazer in his field, he spent the next two decades inspiring countless designers to pursue international awards. In 2022, firsttime Grammy nominees Jheng-Han Li and Wei Yu won Taiwan\u2019s first-ever Grammy in this category for Pakelang, a collaboration between The Chairman and Malan Choirs. The album design, featuring singers\u2019 portraits interwoven with imagery of Taiwan\u2019s mountains and seas, earned Taiwan its first Grammy Award for Best Recording Package.Jheng-Han Li, who started out playing in bands, designed his first album cover for his own group, not just to save money, but also from a desire to make their music visible and collectible. \u201cThere are over seventy categories at the Grammys. Half aren\u2019t about music itself, but all are essential to getting music out into the world.\u201d That simple truth has guided Li throughout his career with unwavering conviction, both as a music lover and a designer.Design as a Language: Complementary Collaboration and CommunicationThe two designers first crossed paths when Wei Yu interned during her university years. A longtime fan of K-pop, she was no stranger to album packaging and had long been fascinated by the inventive formats of Korean albums.

In 2025, she was nominated for the Golden Melody Award for Best Album Design for Wang Pin Liu Freestyle.Founder of Spread Design Studio, Li specializes in commercial design, printing, and album packaging. In addition to his Grammy win, he received Best Album Packaging at the Independent Music Awards for Fairy Tales of Ocean Deep and Time. Together with Wei Yu, he co-designed Pakelang, which won the 2022 Grammy Award for Best Recording Package.In 2022, at the pre-ceremony networking event of the Grammy Awards in the U.S., nominees Wei Yu and Jheng-Han Li wandered through the room. Jheng-Han Li casually struck up a conversation with a stranger beside him and learned the person was a writer responsible for album liner notes; the person lamented how no one knew who he was. Li patted him on the shoulder and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all for music.\u201d It wasn\u2019t meant as comfort, but rather as an expression of his deep understanding of both album packaging design and the other person\u2019s work. After all, those silent yet indispensable details are part of what gives music the chance to be heard and collected.032033","Melodies Made Tangible While studying visual communication design, Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Musicshe set her sights on working in this field, and eventually landed an internship with Jheng-Han Li at Spread Design Studio. With Li\u2019s expertise in handcrafted packaging and Yu\u2019s fluency in digital tools, the two approached design from different angles. They developed a rhythm of back-and-forth dialogue through design, each shaping the visual form in turn.When The Chairman approached Li to design Pakelang, they mentioned plans to submit the album to the Grammys. Without hesitation, Li said yes. The band wasn\u2019t just his senior peers in the music scene; they were his idols. Collaborating with them felt like a dream come true. \u201cYou don\u2019t get many chances in life to do something like this,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIf we mess it up, so be it.\u201d But despite the casual tone, he treated it as a career-defining project and promptly brought Wei Yu on board.The band titled the album after their lead single Pakelang, a song that captures the humor and optimism of the Amis people while helping bring the Malan Choirs to the international stage. When it came to the concept for the album\u2019s packaging, Jheng-Han Li wanted the design to reflect not only the song\u2019s spirit but also to \u201clet the world hear Taiwan.\u201d Drawing inspiration from Taiwan\u2019s land, he used layers of paper to sculpt the contours of its east coast: its mountains and shoreline, forming the die-line for the lyric booklet. He handed the die-line to Wei Yu with a simple instruction: \u201cThink natural terrain, starry skies, Indigenous imagery; something abstract.\u201dThat direction was transformed in Wei Yu\u2019s mind into digital motion imagery, which she then rendered into a series of graphic prints. She carefully laid each one against the dieline template, comparing and refining until she found the visual that fit best. Li recalls with a laugh, \u201cWhen I saw her artwork, I immediately turned to the printer and said, \u2018Working with the right person just makes it easy.\u2019\u201d They exchanged few words, setting no expectations for what the other should produce, just a pure back-and-forth of design ideas. That has since become their unspoken rhythm: regardless of who leads a project, the other offers strong support, building up a final product that meets both their standards.Give Everyone a Reason to Hold On to a Physical AlbumTo showcase the impact of packaging design, Jheng-Han Li puts careful effort into producing The album\u2019s design concept draws inspiration from Taiwan\u2019s landscape, using layered paper to recreate the contours of the eastern coastline and mountain ranges. (Image courtesy of Spread Design Studio)physical mock-ups at every stage of the design process. \u201cYou need to hand them a real sample for them to feel the uniqueness of the packaging,\u201d he says. For him, this tactile experience is key to making an immediate impression. As a designer, he sees packaging as the first gateway to the music, something that grabs attention, invites deeper engagement with the work, and ultimately leads to purchase. \u201cOnly then does the music have a chance to be heard.\u201d For listeners, great packaging adds collectible value, giving people a reason to own it.From Xiao Qing-Yang\u2019s pioneering role in bringing international recognition to Taiwanese album packaging to Jheng-Han Li and Wei Yu\u2019s milestone Grammy win for Pakelang, Taiwanese record design has steadily built its visibility on the global stage. This achievement is closely tied to a shift in how musicians view packaging, as well as the flourishing of design talent in recent years. From visual communication and graphic design to printing techniques and cross-disciplinary image work, Taiwanese designers have not only reached a high level of technical maturity but have also developed a creative language with growing international recognition. This creative force has broadened the visual expression of music, transforming packaging from a supporting role into a core vehicle for aesthetics and storytelling, making design an integral part of the work\u2019s artistic value.Looking ahead, album packaging will likely play an increasingly important role in music production. It not only enhances the listening experience, but also serves as wings, helping the work travel farther. And in doing so, it opens new pathways for Taiwan\u2019s voice to be heard around the world, advancing the global presence and influence of Taiwanese culture.034035","WhereS o u n d ComesAliveWhere Sound Comes AliveSense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicThe lights flare on. A guitar riff slices through the air. A musician takes their first step, and in that instant, emotion floods the room. Moments like this reveal that the power of live music lies not just in its sonic impact, but in its ability to be felt and shared as a real experience. Live houses pulse with the musical heartbeat of the city. Music festivals bring together voices across regions and generations in powerful resonance. Music expos open up industry dialogue and global exchange through performance. Each format goes beyond the act of performing; it becomes a vital force in the growth of Taiwanese pop music. This chapter centers on the many dimensions of live sound, from stages and venues to industry platforms, revealing how music takes place and expands, and continues to shape and extend its influence, driving pop music into its next chapter.2036037","Where Sound Comes AliveOrganized by TMC, TMEX is a music expo that bridges business and fan economies. Its inaugural edition brings together 25 international curators and buyers from 12 countries, alongside more than 20 ticketed music festivals and 40 record labels and talent agencies from Taiwan. Spanning songwriting, production, performance, artist management, festival curation, stage technology, and branding, TMEX encompasses nearly the entire value chain of Taiwan\u2019s music industry. This is not just an exhibition; it is an experiment grounded in the real needs of the industry, seeking to bridge performance and commerce. The goal is to build a sustainable platform for exchange that enables ongoing dialogue with the world.Let the People Behind the Music Be Seen\u201cWe not only hope the public hears the music on stage, but also sees the \u2018dream makers\u2019 behind every creator, the people who are deeply rooted in this land and help weave the fabric of Taiwan\u2019s music industry,\u201d said TMC Chairperson Kay Huang at the 2024 TMEX event.The inaugural TMEX centers on four key pillars: commercial curation, business matchmaking, emerging artist showcases, and international forums. The program mapped out the full spectrum of Taiwan\u2019s music ecosystem Building Bridges for the Industry:How the TAIPEI MUSIC EXPO Became a Platform for Connection and Global ReachWhen we talk about \u201clive music\u201d, it\u2019s not just about the stage under the spotlight. Often, whether a song reaches more listeners, or a performance leads to another opportunity, depends not just on what happens on stage, but on the occasions when the industry comes together. Events like music expos offer songwriters, producers, curators, and buyers the chance to connect face-to-face, opening up new possibilities for pop music. In September 2024, TMC launched the very first TAIPEI MUSIC EXPO (TMEX). At a time when the global music industry is increasingly competitive and streaming numbers are tightening the space for creativity, TMEX brings together creation, performance, and business matchmaking, aiming to build a true bridge between Taiwanese pop music and the world.Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Music038039","Where Sound Comes AliveSense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Musicwhile addressing the real needs of the fan economy. In addition to offering international buyers live performances and face-to-face engagement with industry professionals, TMEX also launched a matchmaking platform to present the richness and diversity of Taiwanese music to the world. Over two days, the event drew an estimated 65,000 attendees, leaving a strong impression on industry delegates from Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and beyond. Malaysian singer-songwriter Anna Chong and Taiwanese band Pacers met during the expo and went on to collaborate. Pacers was invited to perform in a special showcase in Malaysia, which in turn launched their Southeast Asia tour. TMEX thus became more than a networking event; it served as a real launchpad for Taiwan\u2019s music to venture abroad.Building such a platform didn\u2019t happen overnight. According to TMC CEO Eric Liang, TMEX was shaped through a series of in-depth interviews and industry roundtables. \u201cWe personally visited a wide range of music professionals across Taiwan,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd what we consistently heard was a shared desire for more opportunities to connect face-to-face with audiences and peers, to showcase the strength of Taiwan\u2019s music industry, and to open doors to further collaborations.\u201dBuilding a Structured Platform for International ExchangeEven before the official launch of TMEX, TMC had already begun laying the groundwork for international engagement. In 2023, it established an International Advisory Committee that meets virtually every three months, inviting agency heads, music festival curators, and venue operators from around the world to help chart pathways for Taiwanese musicians to connect globally. In 2024, TMC collaborated with the Taiwan Studies Program at the University of Washington in Seattle to bring its permanent exhibition overseas, and also began building a partnership with the Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP). This collaboration later became a highlight of the TMEX International Forum, where MoPOP Executive Director Michele Y. Smith joined TMC Chairperson Kay Huang in a conversation exploring the future of music museums in both the West and Asia.John Huang is one of the key planners behind TMEX. Since 2015, he has been working to promote Taiwanese pop music in the Southeast Asian market. He notes that while many Taiwanese musicians produce outstanding work and have strong followings, they often operate in isolation, lacking both the collaborative knowledge and platforms needed to expand internationally. He especially highlights the high level of creativity and craftsmanship in Taiwan\u2019s album packaging and merchandise production, from printing and paper selection to stickers and wrapping, each detail thoughtfully reflecting the music\u2019s context. He also points to the added value of immersive marketing strategies, such as the band Elephant Gym\u2019s Dreams album, which came with an interactive online personality quiz, creating a layered sensory experience that extended beyond the music itself.However, Huang observes that many Taiwanese artists have limited understanding of the industry\u2019s structure, particularly when it comes to roles like booking agents, tour promoters, or international managers. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to connect with the right partners abroad, often resulting in wasted effort. Huang observed that without a clear commercial mindset and organized workflows, cross-border collaboration can be difficult to LeftMusic curators and buyers from twelve countries gained deeper insight into the vibrancy of Taiwan\u2019s music industr y through TMEX.

In contrast, major events like the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in the United States offer an important point of reference. The launch of TMEX not only fills this long-standing gap but also responds to the real needs of the industry with a flexible and adaptive format.Take the Indian market, for example: with its vast population and immense potential, local musicians there have in recent years begun expressing a growing interest in Taiwanese pop music. In 2024, Huang invited two industry professionals from India to attend TMEX and begin a conversation. These kinds of cross-border connections are precisely what TMEX aims to foster: bringing together all segments of Tai-wan\u2019s domestic music industry while enabling real, concrete international collaborations.Looking to the future, there are hopes to invite even more international participants and to showcase music rooted in Taiwan\u2019s local culture, establishing TMEX as a music expo based in Taipei with a clear orientation toward Asia. Huang shares that some of the most moving feedback he received came from delegates from Indonesia, Vietnam, and even Japan and Korea. Many expressed surprise at the scale and vision of Taiwan\u2019s music industry. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s positioning is actually very clear,\u201d he notes, \u201cso much so that some Southeast Asian delegates went home wondering if they should start a music expo of their own.\u201dIn recent years, Taiwanese musicians have continued creating and performing, waiting for the right moment to be seen. TMEX offers more than just a stage, it brings artists into the broader framework of the industry, allowing them to engage directly with producers, curators, buyers, and fans on the same musical wavelength. From now on, the idea of \u201cthe live music scene\u201d goes beyond the spotlight; it includes those crucial moments and platforms that connect music to the world. This is another kind of stage for Taiwanese pop music, and we\u2019re standing at its very beginning.John Huang led international guests backstage to connect with the performing artists of JAM JAM ASIA.

But for musicians and industry professionals, it is a crucial venue where new voices are discovered and cultural exchange takes root. From artist lineups and scenic design to merchandise and audience experience, every detail shapes how music is presented, understood, and passed on to the next generation. To promote diverse musical exchanges across Taiwan and Asia, TMC launched JAM JAM ASIA (JJA) during the 2024 TAIPEI MUSIC EXPO (TMEX). In 2025, TMC invited a group of music festival pioneers to form a curatorial team: Chen Hsin-Hung (aka NUNO), founder of Emerge Music; Ta-Chien Hsiao, founder of Vagabond Festival and Savage Festival; Tseng Kuo-Hung (aka Kuo-Kuo), founder of Sunset Music; along with MCKY, founder of the label ROMAD, and Hauer, founder of Andafn Co., Ltd.

NUNO began his career running a record label and live house, cultivating Taichung\u2019s music scene for years. In 2019, he launched \u201cEmerge Festival\u201d in his hometown of Qingshui, Taichung. Blending music with a spirit of adventure, the festival invites fans to enjoy performances by both local and international bands while wandering the small town, exploring temple squares, weaving through alleyways, and sampling local cuisine. The festival becomes a cultural gateway into the city itself.Also using music as a cultural medium, TaChien Hsiao\u2019s Vagabond Festival offers a different model of curatorial imagination. Committed to sustainability, he relocated the festival from New Taipei City to Anping in 2020, creating a local experiment that fuses land, history, and environmental awareness. With \u201cMiss SuLan Is Getting Married,\u201d he connected local temple parade troupes; with \u201cLove Hunt in Kunshen,\u201d he reimagined the century-old love story from \u201cA Memorable Melody of Anping,\u201d weaving Tainan\u2019s local narratives into both music and visuals. Coupled with the city\u2019s culinary and travel appeal, the Vagabond Festival has gradually become an annual celebration that music lovers return to year after year.Kuo-Kuo is a trailblazer in the realm of virtual music festivals. Since 2021, he has collaborated with the tech collective NAXS FUTURE on a two-and-a-half-year endeavor to develop the \u201cSunset Town\u201d brand. The project invited artists to film performances at Zepp New Taipei, gradually building the fictional town. By late April 2025, the second edition of Burnout Festival premiered with expanded features, blending video game-style map exploration and missions, multiplayer racing games, NPC interactions, and performances across four virtual stages. While continuing the spirit of \u201cadventure\u201d at its core, the festival also pushed the boundaries of what a music event could be.What Makes Music Festivals So Captivating?A music festival is never just about the music. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s more like a ritual,\u201d says Hsiao TaChien. \u201cIt brings together all kinds of people in the same space to experience a wide range of sensations.\u201dHsiao points out, \u201cWithin a set timeframe, from afternoon into the evening, everyone can experience different music programs. What makes the setting special is that there\u2019s a constant variety of music and activities happening all around.\u201dA music festival is like the gateway to a nation\u2019s export trade. When not only the audience but also backstage crew and international artists feel good about the experience, the performances become all the more sincere, and we feel a real sense of fulfillment.Ta-Chien HsiaoTake Vagabond Festival for example: \u201cWhat fans enjoy most is the sense of gathering and shared participation. But that doesn\u2019t mean they have to be together all the time. Sometimes they bump into friends at the venue and head off together to catch the next show.\u201d In the early days of Emerge Festival, NUNO noticed that most festivalgoers were visiting Qingshui for the first time. To help them explore the town, the festival organized special tours. \u201cMany people, while heading down the mountain to grab a bite, would take the opportunity to linger in the town, sometimes staying at a caf\u00e9 for two or three hours.\u201dEven in a virtual music festival, the live experience extends far beyond the performances Vagabond Festival combines music with beach cleanups and continues to promote the core values of sustainability through diverse initiatives.

You end up living a little happier and a little longer..Kuo046047","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicHsiao Ta-Chien agrees with this view. He admits that inviting well-known headliners is indeed a commercial consideration, but more importantly, he hopes to use them to bring visibility to up-and-coming bands and help them be heard by more people. He gives an example: in order to let audiences discover these promising artists and bands, he schedules them to perform right before the big acts. \u201cThat way, you \u2018have to\u2019 hear the earlier bands,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter trying it a few times, we\u2019ve found that those overseas or lesser-known bands in Taiwan have started to gain more listeners. The impact has been quite significant.\u201d Kuo-Kuo adds candidly that one of the most important functions of a music festival is to broaden listeners\u2019 taste and imagination for music. \u201cOffering a diversity of genres in the lineup allows people to encounter different cultures and sounds. That\u2019s what a successful music festival should do.\u201dWith the same belief and drive, the three, along with MCKY and Hauer, set out to curate the lineup for the second edition of JJA with the goal to shape it into a city-based music festival that elevates the musical tastes of audiences in Taiwan. Over half of the lineup featured international acts, with a deliberate focus on genres rarely seen in Taiwan yet brimming with potential in global markets: reggae, post-rock, metal, electronic, and jazz. The festival also included an all-night DJ party, giving audiences a chance to experience the vibrancy of Taipei\u2019s nightlife. Their hope is for JJA to become both a launchpad for Taiwanese listeners to discover new sounds and a key gateway for international audiences to better understand Taiwan\u2019s musical landscape. All fans need to do is keep their ears open: the musical adventure begins here.If we\u2019re going to support artists or bands in entering international markets, the first step is to place everyone at the same starting line: evaluating their global potential based solely on musical style, not past achievements or popularity.\u2014NUNOthemselves. What stuck with Kuo-Kuo most about Sunset Town was when singer YELLOW Huang Hsuan signed up of his own accord and led a group of players through the online festival map, running around, checking in at various spots, then dispersing. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really do anything, just ran around together. But the way it broke down the boundary between audience and artist made the experience really fun.\u201d For festival organizers, \u201cthe experience is just as important as the lineup. You need a solid sense of curation, but also some kind of added value, something that draws people in to explore. These are the two key challenges for anyone running a music festival.\u201d NUNO emphasized.Establishing Identity Through Artist CurationFor all three festival founders, ticket sales are not the only consideration when selecting artists. Their greater goal is to expand the audience\u2019s listening horizons. \u201cIf we want Taiwan\u2019s music scene to grow richer and more layered,\u201d said NUNO, \u201cwe have to bring in diversity.

From the underground venues of the 1990s like Underworld and SCUM, to today\u2019s professional-grade venues such as SUB and Legacy TERA within TMC, these spaces have borne witness to Taiwanese pop music\u2019s journey from the margins to the heart of the industry. Beyond sound, they carry the aspirations of generations of creators: the desire to be seen, to be understood, and to transform music into a force that reshapes the rhythm of the city, one live show at a time.Dela ChangChi-Kang Chiang Head of the music label Kao!Inc., a key figure in Taiwanese hiphop.

These entertainment venues flourished between the 1950s and 1970s, largely catering to the American military stationed in Taiwan at the time. Many live singers honed their craft in these settings, indirectly ushering Western rock music into Taiwan\u2019s music scene.By the 1990s, as the band scene gained momentum, Taiwan began to see Live Houses emerge in a form similar to those in Japan: venues focused on original music, where musicians no longer simply played background tunes for alcohol service, but rather became the centerpiece of the space itself. From Taipei\u2019s Human Dog Ant, SCUM, and Underworld, to Sanctuary and Black Hole in Taichung, and Yaesu and ATT in Kaohsiung, these venues were often bare-bones and modest in setup, yet they served as vital incubators for Live Houses attract people who share the same vibe. They come together to create something; it becomes a very local, underground sound.Chi-Kang Chiang 052053","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Musicnon-mainstream creativity, harboring sounds that were raw, experimental, and on the fringe. Like wildfire, Live Houses sprang up on the edges of cities, gradually shaping a distinct subculture of underground music in Taiwan.Chi-Kang Chiang , Dela, Sam Yang, and Arthur Chen first crossed paths in these very spaces. For them, Taipei\u2019s iconic Live House of the 1990s Underworld was akin to the legendary CBGB in New York. \u201cIt drew in people who shared the same vibe and ended up creating something together,\u201d said Chiang. \u201cThat kind of culture leaves a mark. It became part of Taipei\u2019s local, underground sound tradition.\u201dFrom the Grey Area to Institutional RecognitionWhile the first generation of Live Houses fostered a vibrant grassroots performance scene, they operated on the fringes of the system. These venues were typically categorized under \u201caudiovisual entertainment businesses,\u201d lumped together with nightclubs and hostess bars. As a result, they faced stringent restrictions on venue usage and activities, along with dense fire safety and building code regulations. \u201cLive Houses existed in a grey area. It wasn\u2019t by choice, but because there simply wasn\u2019t a regulatory framework that fit,\u201d Dela recalled.The third generation of Live Houses comes with more comprehensive functions, becoming a new form of leisure and entertainment space.\u2014Arthur ChenIn 2010, the government introduced a new classification: \u201cmusic performance venue industry.\u201d But the supporting fire and building codes remained unchanged. Matters worsened in 2011 following a deadly fire at Jack Daniels night club in Taichung, which triggered sweeping inspections of nightclubs and live venues across Taiwan. Ill-defined in legal terms, Live Houses became prime targets for enforcement. Fines piled up, and eventually, Taipei\u2019s iconic Underworld was forced to shut down in 2013.The closure of Underworld ultimately ignited a broader movement for industry recognition. Musicians and civil society advocates came together to launch the \u201cLive House Naming Movement,\u201d urging the government to acknowledge the essential role these venues played in Taiwan\u2019s music ecosystem. As a result, a second generation of Live Houses began to emerge in more legitimate, publicly accessible spaces. Venues such as Legacy in Taipei and THE WALL, once located in Kaohsiung\u2019s Pier2 Art Center, chose to situate themselves in cultural and creative districts, seeking a new balance between regulatory compliance and public perception. \u201cThese venues are not just performance spaces; they\u2019re public spaces,\u201d said Dela. \u201cPeople began to willingly walk into Live Houses to listen to music. A culture is taking root, and it\u2019s changing the stigma that once surrounded these places.\u201dToday\u2019s Live House is more than just a performance venue\u2014it should also lead a new lifestyle aesthetic as a brand, helping the music industry move toward sustainability.Sam YangU:NUS performing live at Legacy TERA.

With a budget of NT$60 million, Legacy TERA was outfitted with the most advanced lighting and sound systems among venues of its kind. \u201cWe envisioned it as a model venue for forward-looking performances in Live Houses,\u201d said Arthur Chen. \u201cNot only can it host live music, but its flexibility also makes it ideal for cutting-edge tech showcases, such as 5G and AI exhibitions.\u201d As times change, the role of third-generation Live Houses has expanded beyond serving youth culture alone . \u201cWhile still deeply tied to the music industry, Live Houses have also become a new kind of recreational space.\u201dIn contrast, SUB is a smaller venue that immediately caught the eye of its four-person founding team. \u201cIt has a spacious backstage and a layout that feels organic and adaptable; it\u2019s full of potential for all kinds of creative play,\u201d said Sam Yang. SUB\u2019s programming is not limited to bands; it welcomes alternative, pop, hip-hop, electronic, stand-up comedy, and more. Despite its smaller scale, SUB does not compromise on technical standards; it is equipped to match the specifications of major concert stages, giving emerging musicians the chance to grow in a fully professional environment. \u201cWe see SUB as a training ground,\u201d said Chi-Kang Chiang , \u201ca place where the next generation of musicians can hone their craft.\u201d\u201cWhether it\u2019s the specs, equipment, or professional crew, SUB is the strongest next-generation Live House,\u201d said Sam Yang. But his vision for a contemporary Live House extends beyond a venue for performances; it should be a branded space that leads the music industry toward new aesthetics of living and possibilities for sustainability. So, what does it take to truly become sustainable? For Yang, the key lies in making Live House concerts a part of everyday life. He observed that Taiwan\u2019s Live House audience still consists mostly of students, something he\u2019s acutely aware of as a band frontman. \u201cTen years ago, we had a group of fans who came to almost every show. But as they entered the workforce, got married, and started families, they began attending less and less.\u201d There are many reasons for this drop-off: busy work schedules, partners aren\u2019t into live music, or parenting responsibilities that make Live House settings unsuitable for children. All of these realities gradually create distance between people and the live music experience.This attrition has prompted him to reflect: many Taiwanese families teach their children from a young age that Live Houses are places to be avoided. By the time they grow up and finally gain the freedom to attend, life\u2019s shifting rhythms often pull them away again. \u201cThat\u2019s a real pity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf one day, going to a Live House show becomes as natural a choice as watching a movie or attending a talk, that would be the true foundation for a sustainable music industry.\u201dI\u2019ve always felt that a Live House is like a land god temple.\u2014Dela ChangWhen a Live House Becomes a Land God Temple\u201cI\u2019ve always felt that a Live House is like a land god temple,\u201d said Dela. Not sacred, and not requiring devotion, yet it naturally draws together the most musically attuned, devoted, and passionate people from this land. Every performance becomes a gathering, rich with personality and emotion. Whether you like it or not, whether you\u2019re familiar or just passing by, it exists quietly alongside everyday life, much like a site of belief. \u201cIf it feels right, just buy a ticket and step inside.\u201dFrom underground to aboveground, from the margins to the mainstream, Live Houses have borne witness to the growth of Taiwan\u2019s independent music scene and nurtured countless professionals in both technical and creative fields. They are more than just stages; they are a landscape unto themselves, one of the freest and most sincere corners of Taiwan\u2019s music industry.From Underworld to SUB, from makeshift venues in converted warehouses to the multi-million-dollar Legacy TERA, Taiwan\u2019s music spaces have come a long way, starting as practice grounds for artists and gradually evolving into key hubs in the music industry. Whether as training arenas for the next generation or, as Sam Yang envisions, as lifestyle-driven spaces that embrace sustainability, these Live Houses carry forward cultural legacies while responding to the shifting needs of the industry and its audiences. Today\u2019s Live Houses are no longer just places for performance; they are front-line spaces essential to understanding the soundscape of Taiwan.\u201cA HAPPY Day by Xian-Jing\u201d live performance.

It needs a space, a site that can hold the emotions and memories left behind by sound, while bridging industry and society, the everyday and the global. In Taiwan, that space is the Taipei Music Center. TMC not only brings performances into view; it makes the pulse of pop music tangible and institutionalized, embedding it into the urban landscape. It offers a sustained platform for curating and promoting pop music, allowing for longterm engagement.

Since 2020, she has served as Chairperson of TMC, continuing to build a solid foundation for Taiwan\u2019s pop music industry.Kay HuangIn 2020, TMC officially opened, its three buildings enclosing an open plaza to form an industry hub dedicated to Taiwan\u2019s pop music and culture. Anchored in this expansive site, TMC took on a threefold role: to document the past, engage with the present, and shape the future. It has sought to transform this \u201cmusic base\u201d from a physical landscape into a site of cultural governance in practice. Amid high public expectations, seasoned music professional Kay Huang, known for her work in songwriting, production, and performance, assumed leadership as TMC\u2019s first chairperson. With unbridled passion and decisive action, she guided the team through the challenges of the pandemic, laying a steady foundation from which TMC grew over five years, gradually realizing the mission it was built to fulfill.CEO of TMC.

Since taking office in 2023, he has drawn on his extensive experience as a professional manager to guide the steady growth of TMC.Eric LiangLooking back on the first three years after the opening of TMC, Kay Huang recalls candidly, \u201cThose years were truly exhausting!\u201d She had expected TMC\u2019s launch to be met with an enthusiastic welcome, but instead, it coincided with the full outbreak of the pandemic. Audiences were gripped by uncertainty, performances were repeatedly canceled, and TMC was thrown into an unprecedented state of crisis. Speaking with emotion, she shared that it was thanks to the team\u2019s unwavering solidarity and the support of the Ministry of Culture and Taipei City Government Department of Cultural Affairs that they made it through the most turbulent times. \u201cSome of our team members have stayed with us since then. I\u2019m truly grateful,\u201d she said.During that period, she made a conscious effort to stay open, to keep learning and adapting to the rapidly changing landscape. Yet she does not shy away from admitting that 060061","inside the Taipei Music CenterSense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Musicthe entire three years were lived in a constant state of high tension: \u201cI\u2019ve always been used to working under pressure, but those three years felt like pressure upon pressure. My adrenaline was constantly spiking. Every day felt like a new battle against the unexpected.\u201dShe recalled that whenever she hit a creative block in the past, she would turn to \u201cbig brother\u201d Jonathan Lee for a chat. He once reminded her, \u201cInspiration doesn\u2019t only come from music; you have to find it again in life.\u201d That conversation remains etched in her memory. \u201cHe told me, when you\u2019ve withdrawn everything from your inspiration account, don\u2019t just stay in the studio or at concerts. Go somewhere you\u2019ve never been. Meet people you\u2019ve never met.\u201d Looking back now on those high-pressure days, she describes them as \u201ca difficult yet deeply meaningful lesson, one you could never learn in a studio or onstage.\u201dThough the experience left her physically and mentally drained, Huang knows that everything she endured has quietly become part of the depth she carries forward.Preparing the Soil for Musicians to Take Root\u201cI asked myself, why did I keep pushing through even when I was completely exhausted? It\u2019s because I truly want to see the music industry thrive,\u201d said Huang. She has always believed that TMC exists to lay a deeper foundation for Taiwanese pop music. She likes to describe this mission in terms of \u201ccultivation;\u201d to grow good crops from a piece of land, you don\u2019t just need good seeds; you also need to turn the soil, irrigate it, and care for it. TMC is just such a field. Only by continually activating the campus through performances and events can the soil TMC is already the home of Taiwanese pop music. I hope this home will invite more people in and empower its musicians to go out and share their voices with the world.\u2014Kay Huangbe loosened and enriched, giving more musical seeds the chance to take root and grow.To turn this campus into a fertile field and true home for musicians, TMC accomplished several key milestones between 2020 and 2022. In September 2020, the Concert Hall officially opened with its first rented event. Later that year, TMC launched its first regional event, \u201cTMC Christmas Jazz Party\u201d, combining music and lifestyle experiences and marking the beginning of its public mission. In September 2021, the Cultural Cube opened with the launch of the permanent exhibition \u201cMUSIC, ISLAND, STORIES: Pop Music in Taiwan\u201dand the acclaimed special exhibition \u201cIs Your Time: Ryuichi Sakamoto with Shiro Takatani Installation Music 2,\u201d establishing TMC\u2019s curatorial presence. That same year also saw the debut of its self-produced music festival \u201cOh! Shake It!,\u201d which has since grown in scale and gradually carved out its own identity in the festival landscape.Years in the Making, Finally Speaking to the WorldIn 2022, TMC began taking steps onto the international stage. That year marked the first overseas presentation of its architecture, with the exhibition \u201cLyrical Urbanism: The Taipei Music Center\u201d held at The Cooper Union in New York City.

As the pandemic subsided, commercial spaces surrounding TMC gradually opened, restoring energy to the campus and opening the door to more exchange. That same year, TMC launched its first \u201cTaiwan-France Music Creation Camp,\u201d bringing together musicians from Taiwan and abroad for collaborative creation. It marked the emergence of a dedicated platform where musicians could create and connect.Huang acknowledged that international exchange had always been a goal since the planning stage. However, during the first three years of operation, much of the effort was focused on laying the groundwork, responding to government and council oversight, engaging with neighborhood concerns, and navigating administrative procedures left little time for outward expansion. Still, she pushed forward step by step, drawing on her personal network and taking part herself. From curating the New York exhibition to launching the residency program, she gradually opened the gates to international dialogue, marking a significant milestone in TMC\u2019s development.In 2023, Eric Liang took over as CEO. With a background spanning radio, record labels, and artist management, he brought with him a deep understanding of both the practical operations and administrative structures of the cultural industry. Compared to Huang\u2019s idealistic and visionary style, Liang offered strong organizational and implementation skills. Together, they formed a complementary partnership that gave TMC a more balanced pace and expanded its capacity for growth.\u201cThe title \u2018CEO\u2019 alone suggests how difficult the role is,\u201d Huang reflected. \u201cDuring the first three years, the former CEO worked incredibly hard. We organized all kinds of events during that time, and the entire team was operating under near-constant overload.\u201dLeftChairperson Kay Huang at TMEX, pictured with an installation in the exhibition areaRightCEO Eric Liang speaks at the fifth-anniversary press conference, sharing reflections on TMC\u2019s progress and future vision.\u201cBy 2023, I felt the timing was right, so I formally invited Liang to join us,\u201d said Huang. \u201cWe already had a clear direction, but we needed someone who could truly make things happen on the ground.\u201d After Liang took office, he not only brought greater consistency to the pace of international outreach, but also became a vital bridge between TMC and the city government thanks to his familiarity with the workings of the public sector. \u201cI\u2019m truly grateful to him, for being willing to leave behind a comfortable and stable life to take on this adventure at TMC.\u201dCEO Liang responded candidly: \u201cBefore joining TMC, our understanding from the outside was like looking through a fog. People seemed to only know that there was a performance hall here. In reality, TMC is a full-fledged complex spanning 8.96 hectares, with spaces for performances, exhibitions, commercial use, and offices. It was only after stepping inside that I realized: all of this had been built step by step by Chairperson Huang.\u201dLetting a Diversity of Visions Take Root: Making TMC a Place for EveryoneWhat ultimately convinced Liang to join was something Huang said to him: \u201cCome build a hundred years of pop music with us.\u201d That sentence made him realize that Taiwanese pop music is more than a momentary sensation, it carries the weight of cultural continuity. \u201cIts history deserves to be documented and passed down, and we have the chance to contribute to that legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, at first, I thought TMC was just about running a performance venue. But once I stepped inside, I realized it carries an entire set of public responsibilities. We\u2019re not just here to make music heard, we\u2019re thinking about how to build systems for the whole industry, how to create rhythm and a sense of festivity, and how to deepen the roots of culture.\u201dSince Liang took office, 2023 and 2024 have felt like TMC\u2019s own season of blossoming. In 2023, a wide range of events targeting the general public and local communities were launched: \u201cTMC Happy Island,\u201d themed around family fun; \u201cTMC Golden Voice Contest,\u201d which invited residents of Nangang to participate and celebrate together; and \u201cSoffee Days,\u201d a city music project centered on releasing body and mind. These events brought music into everyday life, helping turn the idea that \u201cmusic is life, life with music\u201d into something truly tangible.064065","inside the Taipei Music CenterSense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicIn 2024, programming became even more diverse, from \u201cTMC NEW STAR,\u201d a platform spotlighting up-and-coming artists, to the nostalgic hit-filled \u201cTMC Weekend Party;\u201d from \u201cWoof Woof: Live!,\u201d a crossover event blending pets and music, to \u201cBetween the Verse,\u201d an in-depth dialogue series exploring songwriting and poetry. These events expanded TMC\u2019s reach and created rich, multi-sensory experiences. More than a place for watching and listening, TMC began to offer a blueprint for music as a lifestyle.Behind this growing spectrum of events is Chairperson Huang\u2019s imagination and drive. She laughed as she recalled how a casual instinct that the plaza might be perfect for a market led her to start collecting favorite brands, jotting them down, and personally messaging or visiting vendors to learn from them. Liang, seated nearby, added, \u201cA lot of times I assumed she was reaching out to people she already knew, but she didn\u2019t. She just genuinely liked their work and approached them with wholehearted sincerity.\u201d\u201cIn the first three years,\u201d Huang explained, \u201cwe focused on launching the Concert Hall and Cultural Cube, and getting the Creative Hub up and running. It wasn\u2019t until recently, with the groundwork laid, that we\u2019ve finally had the capacity to elevate the scale and quality of our events. Whether it\u2019s external collaborations or refining TMC\u2019s own identity, we hope to keep raising the bar.\u201dCreating a Training Ground for the Next Generation of MusicDriven by a dual commitment to ideals and professionalism, TMC continues to expand its talent development programs. From \u201cTMC Cloud\u201d and \u201cSenior Music Club\u201d to \u201cOpen Lab\u201d and the soon-to-launch \u201cStarlink Project,\u201d these initiatives extend upward to engage senior citizens while also fostering the creative ecosystems of younger artists, offering rising bands a chance to be discovered and recognized.In 2024, TMC launched the first-ever \u201cTaipei Music Expo,\u201d addressing a long-standing gap in Taiwan\u2019s music industry by creating a new platform for international exchange. This year, the event is set to grow further, with expanded invitations to overseas partners and continued efforts to build a practical springboard for Taiwanese music creators aiming to enter the Asian market.Beyond talent development and industry platforms, Huang and Liang are especially proud of TMC\u2019s Concert Hall. With its top-tier technical facilities, the venue fills a crucial gap in Taiwan\u2019s music landscape, bridging the space between live houses and arena-scale venues like the Taipei Arena. For many musicians and bands, it has become both a proving ground for honing their craft and a vital stepping stone to larger stages.Five Years On: A Home That Keeps GrowingOn April 1, 2025, TMC marks its fifth anniversary. These days, the campus hums with life nearly every weekend: music markets, mini fan signings, and performances by artists of all generations unfold across the grounds. Families, couples, friends, and music lovers gather, some drawn by a specific show, others simply stopping by for a coffee or to quietly take in an exhibition. The entire space radiates a sense of openness and freedom.\u201cI often see children laughing with joy in the plaza, and once I heard someone playing a saxophone alone at dusk,\u201d shares Huang. \u201cThis place is meant to be open for everyone to enjoy music freely.\u201d She adds, \u201cTMC places no limits; this is a home where all forms of music are welcome.\u201dShe continues, \u201cTMC is already the home of Taiwanese pop music.

It brings together creation, recording, performance, and exchange, connecting all parts of the music industry and enabling the pulse of Taiwanese pop music to resonate both on and beyond the island.Realizing the vision of rooting pop music locally while expanding its reach globally requires more than just operating a venue. It demands a comprehensive industrial strategy and institutional framework. To this end, the TMC board has brought together representatives from the Ministry of Culture, the Taipei City Government, music industry professionals, and members of academia to form an interdisciplinary team. Together, they have outlined a future blueprint for Taiwanese pop music across four key pillars: park management, industry development, talent cultivation, and international exchange.Building an Experimental Hub to Connect the Entire Industry ChainIn terms of \u201cpark management,\u201d TMC has always looked beyond venue operations to envision the entire campus as a living laboratory for the music industry. Through its circular layout, the Concert Hall, Cultural Cube, and Creative Hub are seamlessly linked, enabling a complete production pipeline, from creation and recording to rehearsal and performance, all within one site. The campus includes four live houses, two rehearsal studios, four professional recording studios, and an outdoor performance area that accommodates up to 3,000 people, making it a hub where artists build creative momentum and where all segments of the industry connect.At the same time, TMC positions its facilities as a base for \u201cindustry development,\u201d inviting music-related brands and teams to set up on-site. This approach fosters vertical integration across the value chain and opens new opportunities for commercial partnerships and innovation. TMC also embraces emerging technologies to explore the future of music in both content production and platform delivery.From Talent to Voice: Building Long-Term MomentumTo keep the industry moving forward, the key lies in a steady stream of talent. Since its establishment, TMC has regarded \u201ctalent cultivation\u201d as one of its core missions. It has launched a range of diverse programs, aiming to foster a sense of collectivity and participation in music culture across generations. These proPop music doesn\u2019t just exist between headphones and stages; it needs a physical home, a base where it can be felt, nurtured, and sustained. Such a place is not only for documentation and preservation, but also for fueling continued creativity and industrial growth. Visiting a music center means stepping into the heart of the industry\u2019s ecosystem, where infrastructure meets cultural governance, and where creators and audiences converge. TMC provides precisely this kind of starting point: a place where Taiwan\u2019s pop music can build momentum, form shared visions, and expand outward. This section invites you to explore the foundation and evolution of TMC, how it has taken shape, how it honors what came before, and how it is charting a path into the future of Taiwanese pop music.068069","Inside the Taipei Music Centerinside the Taipei Music CenterSense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Musicgrams go beyond skill training, they cultivate a foundational \u201cawareness of the music ecosystem\u201d and inject long-term momentum into the future of Taiwan\u2019s pop music scene.In addition to putting down roots, TMC is also actively expanding outward. On the \u201cinternational exchange\u201d front, it has formed advisory teams, introduced overseas resources, and planned showcases, tours, and talent exchange programs. From its dialogue and collaboration with Seattle\u2019s Museum of Pop Culture to bringing \u201cMusic, Island, Stories: Pop Music in Taiwan\u201d abroad, these efforts have not only raised the visibility of Taiwanese music but also strengthened its voice in global music culture, allowing the world to witness the island\u2019s creative force. For the general public, TMC is a place where they can experience music in person and take part in pop culture as part of everyday life. For the industry, it is a strategic platform that integrates creation, production, performance, and exchange, forming a cultural ecosystem with both substance and support.

These buildings form the backbone of Taiwan\u2019s pop music ecosystem. Designed by U.S. firm RUR Architecture, TMC was inspired by the layout of ancient Roman forums. A circular pathway and sculptural bridges connect the north and south ends of the campus, linking the three buildings into a powerful hub of musical energy.Three Landmark Venues Powering the Music Dream: Exploring the Design and Function of TMC\u2019s SpacesDesigned to resemble a glowing crystal, the Creative Hub symbolizes the energy forged through the continual refining and polishing at the heart of pop music creation. More than just a workspace for musicians, it is a dynamic, multifunctional space for production, development, performance, and everyday experiences, a hub where music and urban life meet.The Creative Hub houses four live houses, with capacities ranging from 200 to 1,600 people, along with music classrooms, rehearsal studios, offices, and recording rooms that support artists through every stage, from songwriting and rehearsing to taking the stage. Beyond creation-focused spaces, it also integrates a variety of lifestyle businesses: a vinyl and headphone boutique, piano experience hall, accordion workshop, vintage select shop, as well as cafes, tea houses, and bars. In doing so, it opens up music as an approachable cultural experience not just for professionals, but for the wider public.Through this integrated design, the Creative Hub is more than a physical space for creation; it\u2019s a platform for industry-wide dialogue and a gateway for community engagement. Here, pop music flows into daily life, forging new connections and vitality throughout the industry.Creative Hub\uff5cBridging Music, Industry, and Everyday Life072073","Inside the Taipei Music CenterSense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicShaped like a striking geometric cube, the Cultural Cube is Taiwan\u2019s first museum dedicated to pop music.

In 2023, it turned the spotlight to a figure often overlooked yet essential in the music world: the arranger. The exhibition \u201cChen Chih-Yuan: Prodigy of the Generation\u201d centered on the art of arrangement, tracing Chen\u2019s three-decade career and redefining the invisible core of pop music creation.From Never Look Back, The Same Moonlight, and Thinking of You Every Day, to In Love with Someone Who Never Comes Home, these golden hits that shaped generations were carried not only by the voices of singers but also by the arrangements that gave them emotional texture. Through this special exhibition, TMC sought to broaden the public\u2019s perspective, revealing the creative labor behind every moving song.Spanning thirteen exhibition areas and showcasing nearly a thousand artifacts, the exhibition recreated Chen\u2019s creative life through retro atmospheres, lighting design, and interactive installations; it also guided visitors through Taiwan\u2019s golden age of pop music. At the same time, TMC advanced its \u201cDigital Smart Venue Transformation Initiative,\u201d launching an online platform that allowed the public to explore the exhibition beyond the physical boundaries of time and space.

Together, they map out his evolution in rock, the influences of his time, and the humanistic, experimental, and artistic ideals woven into his music. The exhibition then dissects two of Chang\u2019s iconic songs, The River and Words Untrue, by isolating their original tracks to reveal the intricacies of instrumentation, arrangement, rhythm, and vocal production. A new generation of artists, Cheer Chen, Accusefive, WeiBird, 9m88, and Yeemao, join the project to reinterpret his works, bridging eras through creative adaptation. The experience culminates in a curatorial documentary, bringing this \u201cspace voyage\u201d to a close. Following Tom Chang\u2019s creative trajectory, the exhibition ventures into the heart of his music, imbuing the classics with new meaning.

The group brings together managers from agencies around the world, operators of performance venues, and international curators of music festivals. Through regular video conferences and in-person visits, the group has built a long-term dialogue mechanism and launched a series of substantive exchanges. These interactions not only provide opportunities to share industry research and international insights but also open up new pathways for the global development of Taiwanese music.Cross-Border Co-Creation: Connecting Asia\u2019s Live Music ScenesTMC began its collaboration in 2023 with one of its International Advisory Group members, the Busan International Rock Festival (BIRF). Founded in 2000 as a free event, BIRF transitioned to a ticketed festival in 2019 and has since forged strong partnerships with leading music festivals across Asia, with Taiwan playing a key role in this network.The two parties launched the \u201cInternational Artist Exchange Program,\u201d with singer-songwriter L8ching representing Taiwan in the program\u2019s inaugural year in Korea. In 2024, Explore the Boundless PossibilitiesFrom Taipei to the World: How TMC Is Shaping the Future of the Music Industry through Global CollaborationThe internet has made it easier for creative work around the world to be seen, but it has also caused countless great pieces of music to be drowned in the tide of information. For Taiwan\u2019s pop music industry to truly be heard, it cannot rely solely on the chance of going viral; it requires a more systematic push and a long-term strategy. \u201cExplore the Boundless Possibilities\u201d is a series of international collaborations that embody a proactive spirit of outreach and deepening dialogue. From International Advisory Groups to collaborating with Korea and Japan, and organizing large-scale exchange platforms, TMC is mapping out a global industrial landscape for Taiwanese music, where every foray abroad is not just participation, but initiative.104105","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Musicthe baton was passed to the band Constant & Change (KST). According to BIRF, the selection process placed particular emphasis on the artists\u2019 live performance strength and overall stage presence. Both L8ching and KST were recognized for their \u201cblend of experimentation and approachability,\u201d which was exactly the performance style they were looking for.Collaboration goes beyond one-way cultural export. Following L8ching\u2019s appearance at BIRF, TMC hosted \u201cSoffee Days\u201d later that year, during which BIRF returned with their band ANDOR, creating an opportunity for two-way exchange. Taking things further, BIRF\u2019s signature series \u201cRoad to BU-ROCK\u201d was brought overseas for the first time, staging in Taipei in 2025. Multiple Korean and Taiwanese bands took turns performing at TMC, marking a pivotal moment as the series expands beyond Korea. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t met TMC,\u201d BIRF admitted, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t have imagined getting this far.\u201dThey further emphasized that most public institutions approach international exchange as short-term projects or one-off collaborations. In contrast, TMC chose to establish an \u201congoing\u201d advisory group, building trust over time and naturally expanding the scope of cooperation to the private sector. This has enabled meaningful exchanges among record labels, fostered networks of independent live venues, and encouraged regional music festivals to collaborate and share resources. The advisory group has thus become a working platform, not a symbolic gesture. This structural approach has not only deepened Taiwan\u2019s engagement on the international music stage but also injected stable, sustained momentum into the broader Asian music industry.Bringing Independent Musicians to the World through International ExchangeRyota Nishimura, head of the Tokyo-based live house \u201cduo MUSIC EXCHANGE,\u201d is one of the most engaged members of TMC\u2019s International Advisory Group. A long-time advocate of Taiwan\u2013Japan music exchange, Nishimura has helped facilitate numerous cross-border performances and collaborations, giving him a deep understanding of Taiwan\u2019s music scene. He notes that Taiwan is a key benchmark in the Asian market in terms of both music sales and audience engagement, possessing real potential to become a regional hub for transnational music exchange.Reflecting on how he first joined the advisory group, Nishimura credits Emerge Festival founder Lao Nuo. At the time, he wasn\u2019t sure what role he could play, but the sincerity and passion of the TMC team convinced him to participate. As the exchanges grew deeper, he came to realize that international cooperation rarely develops organically without active coordination and clear planning. Because the group includes members from various countries, \u201cduo MUSIC EXCHANGE\u201d has since been able to forge connections with music industry partners in Korea, Malaysia, and beyond, broadening the possibilities for collaboration.For Nishimura, who has long worked to promote Taiwan\u2013Japan music exchange, these partnerships have not only expanded his team\u2019s practical experience with overseas industries, but also sharpened their understanding of how to support emerging musicians, offering them real opportunities to step onto the global stage.LeftSiva Yuan, veteran music critic and member of the TMC International Advisory Group, moderates the TMEX International Forum.Right\u201dRoad to BU-ROCK\u201d marked the first overseas edition of BIRF\u2019s showcase series, launching at TMC with multiple Taiwanese and Korean acts performing in rotation.

A long-time observer of global music industry trends, Yuan regularly contributes in-depth observations for TMC. He notes that Taiwan was once a major R&D hub for the Mandarin pop music market, boasting top-tier musicians, arrangers, and songwriters. Even today, Taiwan remains one of the most creatively free and stylistically diverse regions in the Mandarin-speaking world. However, amid the rapid transformation of the global industry, Taiwan still lags in areas such as intellectual property law, technology integration, and commercial marketing, resulting in institutional and structural shortcomings.Take the case of AI-generated music, which has become a hot topic in recent years. While the issue is still largely in the discussion phase in Taiwan, the U.S. and Europe have already moved toward implementation. Some regions are proposing legislation that would require prior authorization for AI-generated music, while certain companies are developing analytical tools capable of detecting whether generative content borrows from existing works, automatically triggering royalty distribution mechanisms. These examples reflect the proactive stance international markets are taking toward emerging technologies, with swift adjustments being made in areas ranging from creative ethics and intellectual property to commercial frameworks.Yuan believes that closely following such global developments can help Taiwan anticipate future industry directions and attract more cross-disciplinary talent to join the music sector. This could help address structural gaps and enable Taiwan\u2019s music industry to grow in a more sustainable and robust manner.Building a Resilient Industry with a Global OutlookSiva Yuan also emphasizes that for Taiwan to truly connect with the international community, initiatives like the launch of TAIPEI MUSIC EXPO in 2024 represent a vital step forward. The key lies in consciously positioning TMC within the context of institutions of similar scale around the world, creating meaningful opportunities for interaction and structural alignment. For instance, South by Southwest (SXSW), a globally influential music festival, expanded to Sydney, Australia in 2023. Given that its schedule closely aligns with that of the Expo, the TMC team can take advantage of this overlap to deepen ties with Australia, effectively positioning Taiwan as a key node in the global music industry network.In a rapidly shifting industry landscape, TMC is not merely a passive observer of trends but an active participant, building cross-regional and cross-disciplinary dialogue networks that support new mechanisms and models for industrial growth. These efforts demonstrate that the goal of \u201cExplore the Boundless Possibilities\u201d is not only about stylistic exchange or stage mobility; it is also about institutional innovation, strategic planning, and cultivating meaningful global linkages. Only through such approaches can Taiwan\u2019s voice be heard consistently within the global music arena.The TMEX International Forum gathers professionals from across Asia and Taiwan to share firsthand insights on pressing issues in the music industry.Ryota Nishimura, director of duo MUSIC EXCHANGE, speaks at the TMEX Forum on operating a Live House, engaging in dialogue with fellow speakers from across the region.The TMEX combines branded showcases, international forums, industry matchmaking, and music performances to create a multifaceted platform for exchange.108109Explore the Boundless Possibilities","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicIn 2016, Apple Music officially entered the Taiwanese market, forming a competitive triad with KKBOX and Spotify in the music streaming industry.

As a result, although the market has become increasingly segmented, listeners still struggle to absorb the flood of new songs uploaded daily, and the sheer volume on streaming platforms has diluted the visibility of each release.Meanwhile, beloved classics continue to circulate. Lee observes that whether it\u2019s in film and TV production, radio programming, or casual listening, royalties still mostly go to old songs. This significantly affects how royalties are distributed on streaming platforms. He uses film soundtrack strategy as an example: \u201cSometimes a new song is needed for a theme track, but the film still needs to weave in a few classics.\u201d Creating resonance through the greatest common denominator is the built-in advantage of old songs, making it even harder for new music to be heard.Reflecting on the nearly ten years since music streaming became widespread in Taiwan, Chen notes that its impact was relatively positive in the earlier years, as many independent new voices were able to reach wider audiences. However, he also points out, \u201cThe downside in the later years is that creators are easily swayed by online trends. They start wondering if they should write a certain kind of song, or shorten their tracks to suit the streaming format. But I think what really matters is how to present your content in a compelling way, not letting form become a restrictive framework.\u201dMusic Forms That Morph with the Times and Their Mediums\u201cIn today\u2019s pop music, it\u2019s true that intros are shortened and the most important parts are packed into the first 30 seconds to maximize play counts,\u201d says Lee, speaking frankly about the changes brought by the streaming era. He notes that music production now often requires the same level of dedication once reserved for an entire album to be poured into a single song, even into just the first 30 seconds.Yet, adapting music to its format isn\u2019t new in the history of pop. Chen points out, \u201cWhat we now consider the typical pop music structure: verse, chorus, then chorus again, is actually a fairly recent development.\u201d Back in the early 20th century, the prevalent 78 RPM SP records could only hold under three minutes of music, so songs often included just a single verse and chorus. \u201cThe storytelling songs we associate with Bob Dylan or The Beatles came later.\u201dLee also recalls, \u201cWhen producing vinyl records in the past, you had only 20 minutes per side, so timing had to be carefully controlled and trade-offs were inevitable.\u201d Song structure and narrative modes have continually evolved with changes in format. Chen adds, \u201cWe tend to assume streaming has shortened songs, but tracks like Birds of a Feather, which runs close to four minutes, still rack up hundreds of millions of streams on Spotify. So ultimately, Streaming or not, musicians should begin by truly knowing themselves and figuring out what they want to say.Shou-Chuan Lee112113Explore the Boundless Possibilities","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Musicit comes down to whether the song\u2019s content and form are well integrated.\u201dRising Above the Streaming Tide with Local VoicesIn reflecting on the challenges of the streaming era, Lee repeatedly emphasizes the need to return to the essence of music itself. Chen echoes this view, saying that creation must be rooted in one\u2019s own lived experience. \u201cCharli XCX is hugely popular right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can replicate her sound or style. What matters most is drawing nourishment from your physical surroundings and everyday life; that\u2019s how you know who you\u2019re singing to and what kind of song to sing. That\u2019s where the power comes from.\u201d He once again refers to 8\u00bd, noting that the songs are not projections of inner fantasies or worldly desires, but grounded observations that foster a genuine sense of connection. That tangible quality is what makes the work resonate more deeply.Looking back to the era when those songs were born, Lee notes, \u201cBack then, you could clearly tell American rock from British rock, or What matters most is drawing nourishment from your physical surroundings and everyday life; that\u2019s how you know who you\u2019re singing to and what kind of song to sing. That\u2019s where the power comes from.Kuan-Heng ChenAfrican music. But once globalization kicked in, those distinctions started to blur, and today, they\u2019re nearly impossible to make.\u201d Streaming has erased many of music\u2019s boundaries. If we hope to carve out a distinct space in this vast landscape, perhaps the path forward lies in rediscovering what constitutes a truly local sound, something well worth cultivating in our time.Chen describes the tension between cultivating a local voice and connecting with the international stage as two constantly shifting forces: \u201cIt feels like the right time to revisit the question of what kind of music only we can make. If we don\u2019t have that conversation, we\u2019ll stay trapped in endless debates about how to adapt to different platforms. But platforms are ultimately neutral; the real issue is whether the creator truly has something to say.\u201dLee adds, \u201cMusic has never needed much explanation. Just let time bear witness.\u201d No matter how formats or environments change, good music endures. The future remains something worth looking forward to.114115Explore the Boundless Possibilities","Cover for Sandee Chan\u2019s single Teach Me the Ways to Be Your Love (Image courtesy of Da Le Music Corporation)Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicSandee Chan:A veteran music producer and singer-songwriter known for her experimental sound and sharp social commentary. Her album Then We All Criedwon Best Mandarin Album and Best Album Producer at the 16th Golden Melody Awards. In 2019, she served as Jury Chair of the 30th Golden Melody Awards.AI Is Already Changing Music CreationSandee Chan on Technology\u2019s Role in Shaping Artistic Choices and PossibilitiesWhen an AI-generated voice becomes indistinguishable from a human one, will the value of singers and songwriters be redefined? On White Day 2023, musician Sandee Chan released a new single, Teach Me the Ways to Be Your Love. Launching a love-themed song on Valentine\u2019s Day seemed like a natural choice. However, just days later, Chan revealed on social media that the track had not been sung by her, but by \u201cAI Sandee Chan.\u201d Even the single\u2019s cover art was AI-generated. The announcement sparked immediate debate across the music world.The release of Teach Me the Ways to Be Your Love was more than just a new single, it sent shockwaves through ongoing conversations about the boundaries between technology and creativity. Sandee Chan intentionally withheld the fact that the song was AI-generated, hoping it would be listened to on social media and streaming platforms without preconceived bias. Once the truth came to light, the song immediately sparked intense discussion online.\u201cAI Sandee Chan\u201d was trained using a vast archive of her original master recordings. These masters, consistent in both format and recording fidelity, provided an ideal dataset for engineers to build the model. Chan was involved in every step of the process, from data provision and debugging to post-generation refinements, making her not only the vocal source but also a co-thinker throughout the creative process.This project originated from a collaboration with Taiwan AI Labs and was initially part of a technological development initiative meant to showcase Taiwan\u2019s potential in AI-driven music innovation. However, for Chan, it was more than just a demonstration of technical prowess; it was an artistic endeavor requiring careful craftsmanship. She deliberately wrote the lyrics from the AI\u2019s first-person perspective, using the metaphor of \u201clearning to love\u201d to reflect the AI\u2019s learning process. Through this narrative, she also raised broader questions about the relationship between humans and technology.During production, she and her team engaged in multiple rounds of contract negotiations concerning legal regulations and copyright. Yet with technology evolving so rapidly, existing laws often lag behind, and the best they could do was to clearly define the scope of authorization within the agreements. For Chan, rather than worrying about how technology might be used, it\u2019s more urgent to confront a deeper question: How can we set effective guidelines and boundaries for something we do not yet fully understand? Her concern isn\u2019t that innovation will be stifled, but that prematurely opening the floodgates before humanity has grasped the full implications could pose the greater risk.When Music Becomes Background Noise, How Do We Measure the Value of Creation?Chan recalls that when she first began making music, she was still recording with analog tape. When digital music emerged, many veteran sound engineers were resistant to the change, but she was optimistic. To her, digital technology broke down the barriers of space and capital, making music creation more accessible and opening up a world of possibilities. \u201cBut in my mind,\u201d she notes, \u201cI still think in terms of traditional industry standards when deciding how to use these tools.\u201d What truly concerns her today is how many young creators rely on digital tools with little critical thought, often defaulting to preset options.She gives an example: when she receives audio files from young musicians, she often finds they\u2019ve cut all frequencies below 120Hz, simply because those low-end sounds are \u201cbarely audible\u201d in digital environments. But what they may not realize is that these frequencies are crucial to mixing, post-production, and the construction of the overall sonic space. \u201cAssuming something is unimportant just because you can\u2019t hear it,\u201d she says slowly, \u201creveals a kind of cognitive blind spot: when we know nothing about something, we tend to assume it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dWhen asked how to navigate the boundaries of human-AI co-creation, Chan paused for a moment and laughed: \u201cAt the pace AI is advancing, it probably won\u2019t need to collaborate with humans much longer.\u201d As an artist still active in the field, she\u2019s also acutely aware that music is no longer \u201cindispensable\u201d in modern life. Instead, it is more like auxiliary services for various occasions. And most people don\u2019t really care whether a song was created by a human or by AI.Even as the landscape keeps shifting, Chan chooses to uphold traditional industry standards in her creative process, drawing from social issues and real-life observations to make music that speaks to the present. For her, creating isn\u2019t just about making a pleasant song, it\u2019s a sustained inquiry into aesthetics and what it means to be human. \u201cWho knows,\u201d she says with a wry smile, \u201cmaybe in the future AI will want to collaborate with me.\u201d Her tone is tinged with her signature blend of detachment and mischievous, princess-like humor.116117Explore the Boundless Possibilities","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Musicerences, and expressive habits. While producers can amplify certain traits, they cannot easily change them. Virtual characters, on the other hand, offer complete creative freedom, from background story and personality to musical style, every element can be reimagined and restructured according to the team\u2019s vision, allowing them to break free from convention.However, a considerable gap often exists between imagination and execution, especially when the language of art and the language of engineering fail to align, leading to communication bottlenecks. For instance, when Mila Mii entered the initial 3D modeling stage, the results diverged significantly from the original design concept. Yet when Chen tried to explain the adjustments needed, the engineering team responded with a request for \u201cdata.\u201d He chuckled, \u201cBut there\u2019s no data for aesthetics; it\u2019s just a feeling!\u201d This challenge ultimately led him to pursue further study at the National Taiwan University Institute of Industrial Engineering, in hopes of better translating between the two disciplines and building a bridge between technology and creativity.AI won\u2019t replace creativity, but it will change the creatorsChen candidly acknowledges that many people still hold doubts about AI\u2019s role in music creation: if a piece is no longer initiated by a human, can it still be called a \u201ccreation\u201d? Yet he asserts that, at its current stage, AI-generated content still requires significant human judgment and professional input before it can be shaped into a releasable work.Take the music production process for Mila Mii as an example. The team didn\u2019t simply input ideas into a system; they had to provide clear instructions and parameters to help the AI grasp the song\u2019s concept and emotional arc. Only then could they extract one or two promising \u201cmotifs\u201d from the massive pool of generated material. From there, human arrangers, live musicians, and a production team meticulously refined and developed the ideas into a fully realized song ready for release.\u201cMany people assume that using AI for creation simply means typing in a few prompts and turning the output directly into a product. But for professional creators, that kind of result is far from ready,\u201d Chen emphasizes. The real skill, he says, lies not in what the AI generates, but in the ability to discern which materials are valuable, and then transform them into complete, compelling works.In fact, this kind of skepticism toward new technologies is nothing new. As far back as forty years ago, the advent of MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) also sparked fears about creators being replaced. But in hindsight, those worries never came true. Instead, technology enriched the creative vocabulary and expanded the tools available to musicians. \u201cIn the past, all you needed to write a song was a guitar. Now, you also need to understand MIDI and know how to use a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation),\u201d Chen says with a smile. In an era of rapid technological advancement, it\u2019s not creators who are being left behind, it\u2019s those unwilling to learn new tools.From MIDI to AI, every wave of technological innovation has brought with it uncertainty and anxiety. Yet it is precisely because of this that creators must continually learn and adapt their roles. For Chen, AI is not a threat, it is a powerful extra pair of hands, a far-seeing telescope in the creative process. It helps him stand on the shoulders of giants, enabling him to do more, see further, and unlock new experimental possibilities that were once hard to imagine.\u201cEven with AI, creators still need fundamental musical literacy in order to truly master the technology, instead of being mastered by it.\u201d This is a principle Chen firmly upholds, and it encapsulates his belief in the boundaries of technological application. With this mindset, he and his team continue to develop a growing cast of distinctive, stylistically diverse virtual artists, expanding the ways in which the virtual realm and music can intersect.Eric ChenFounder of Enjoy Music and veteran music producer. Former chair of the Golden Melody Awards jury, he has collaborated with numerous artists including Jody Chiang and Penny Tai. In recent years, he has focused on cross-disciplinary experimentation at the intersection of music creation and technological application.AI Won\u2019t Replace You, But You\u2019ll Need to Level Up:How Eric Chen Experiments with Virtual Artists to Explore the Future of Music CreationFrom visual design and costume styling to music production and vocal performance, every detail of Mila Mii was crafted through collaboration among a cross-disciplinary team. In 2025, she took the stage at the Taipei Arena, becoming the first Taiwanese virtual singer to hold a large-scale concert. This milestone in technological application also marked a vivid symbol of the evolving landscape of cultural content. This deep integration of music and technology prompts an even more intriguing question: unbound by physical limitations, how was this virtual artist brought into being? And what new possibilities does her emergence unlock for music creation?The Birth of a Virtual Idol: A Dialogue Between Technology and MusicThe origins of this cross-disciplinary collaboration trace back to the pandemic. During that time, Eric Chen began wondering whether he could leverage his decades of experience in artist management and music production to create a \u201cvirtual idol,\u201done unbound by geography or the constraints of live performance, capable of staging simultaneous shows across the globe. At the same time, Inventec was seeking to move beyond its role as a hardware manufacturer and expand into content creation and cultural applications. Facilitated by the Taiwan Creative Content Agency (TAICCA), the two sides joined forces: Chen and his team took charge of character development and music production, while Inventec handled 3D modeling and motion generation, setting off on an ambitious and experimental journey across industries.Speaking on the differences between virtual artists and human performers, Chen noted that real-life artists come with established personalities, voices, pref118119Explore the Boundless Possibilities","M a k e a S o u n d into the Future5Make a Sound into the FutureSense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicWhat will the music of the future sound like?

To ensure that musicians and listeners of all generations receive the support and training they need, as a vital hub for the industry, TMC has launched a range of initiatives. These programs aim to provide aspiring musicians of all ages with a path forward into the future.Since its opening, TMC has actively offered a wide range of talent development programs, reaching participants from youth and students to senior citizens. These initiatives provide resources both in depth and breadth. This approach reflects the vision of TMC Chairperson Kay Huang, who explains: \u201cWe hope TMC becomes fertile soil for the music industry to grow, a place where every seed can take root, sprout, and thrive in good health. By grounding TMC on a solid foundation, we\u2019re creating a home where everyone who loves music can safely draw nourishment and grow strong.\u201dOpening Up Music Resources: A Shared World of SoundWith this spirit in mind, TMC has launched a variety of initiatives, including \u201cTMC Cloud,\u201d \u201cSenior Music Club,\u201d and \u201cOpen Lab,\u201d while actively preparing a comprehensive talent development program known as the Starlink Project. These programs may appear independent, but together they form a coordinated effort to pave the way for Taiwan\u2019s pop music industry.\u201cTMC Cloud,\u201d a sub-brand under TMC dedicated to talent cultivation, was created in response to a gap observed in the education system: the lack of accessible resources for nurturing creative skills. Taking the perspective of \u201ccreatives,\u201d TMC designed the TMC CL-1, a user-friendly, online music creation tool that allows anyone, regardless of formal training in music theory, to experiment and compose melodies. Since its launch in 2023, the tool has been used more than 1.3 million times. Many users shared: \u201cThis is much easier than I expected and way more fun!\u201dIn the process of promoting these initiatives, TMC also began to confront deeper structural issues within music education, such as the gap between formal and informal systems, and the disconnect in both resources and mindset. Make a Sound into the FutureSense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Music122123","This led to a firm commitment to building an Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop Musiconline platform for learning and co-creation. Unlike typical online media or databases, what sets \u201cTMC Cloud\u201d apart is its integration of industry resources with real opportunities for interaction and updates on the latest trends. \u201cTMC Cloud\u201d functions as a community, a space where like-minded music creators can come together to learn and have fun.From Early Training to Global Reach: Building a Complete Pathway in MusicIf \u201cTMC Cloud\u201d is a platform that \u201copen-sources\u201d musical knowledge and technique, then the launch of \u201cOpen Lab\u201d in 2022 was designed especially for students in colleges, universities, and high schools across Taiwan who aspire to create music. The program invites them into TMC to develop their own performances from scratch, combining show planning and musical content with professional workshops and hands-on training, bridging theory and practice. In 2023 and 2024, \u201cOpen Lab\u201d further expanded through collaborations with the \u201c1500 Sound Academy Taiwan\u201d and the \u201cwe are SNEAKER AGES - Taiwan\u201d program organized by xzonemusic, aiming to help Taiwan\u2019s emerging musical talent look toward the world stage. \u201cOpen Lab isn\u2019t just about nurturing talent; that\u2019s something we\u2019ve always done. It\u2019s also about giving young people a stage to perform,\u201d said Kay Huang. \u201cPrograms like this remind us of who we were when we were young, passionate about performing and making music.\u201dBy 2025, \u201cOpen Lab\u201d had not only doubled its number of applicants compared to the previous year, but had also built a strong reputation across campuses. It even became a key program that senior members of music clubs would eagerly recommend to their successors. Between 2022 and 2025, \u201cOpen Lab\u201d helped nurture a number of promising new bands, such as Seizer, a group that formed less than six months before being named one of the \u201cTop 10 New Music Acts of 2024\u201d at the second annual StreetVoice Awards. The band members shared that it was through joining \u201cOpen Lab\u201d that they decided to come together as a group: \u201cHow do we bring the sound we imagine onstage into reality? How do we organize an event? How do we sell tickets? Open Lab taught us so much, from administrative tasks to stage tech.\u201dTo consolidate talent development resources across its various initiatives and build a complete pipeline from early-stage training to international exposure, TMC is now actively preparing the Starlink Project. This upcoming initiative will integrate \u201cOpen Lab,\u201d \u201cTaipei Music Nonstop,\u201d and various in-house performance opportunities at TMC. The goal is to connect artists to the international music scene, culminating in industry exposure through the TAIPEI MUSIC EXPO.In an Aging Society, Seniors Can Be Rising Stars TooEducation and learning have never been the exclusive domain of the young. In the face of an aging society, older adults represent an often-overlooked group with great potential. To support seniors who love music but lack access to participate, TMC launched the \u201cSenior Music Club,\u201d offering courses such as finger drumming and ones that integrate digital tools like digital score arranging, as well as a senior-friendly DJ class developed in collaboration with on-site partner Pioneer DJ. To promote intergenerational learning, the program also encourages joint enrollment by older and younger participants. Current students range from 76-year-old seniors to high school students under 20 years old. On one occasion, a son even signed up with his mother as a birthday gift for her. In 2024, the \u201cSenior Music Club\u201d held a showcase event in the TMC Cultural Cube\u2019s lobby.

Drawing on their experience as industry veterans and educators, senior producer and second-term TMC board members Hsiao-Wen Ting and Jamie Hsueh, as well as songwriter and lyricist Yi-Wei Wu reflect on how to nurture confident and articulate new voices in an age dominated by streaming and metrics.What Must MusiciansLearn in the Next Decade?Challenges and Opportunities in Contemporary Music Education126127Make a Sound into the Future","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicTo talk about nurturing the future, one must first understand the past and present. HsiaoWen Ting and Jamie Hsueh, both in their early sixties, alongside Yi-Wei Wu, age forty-two, represent two different generations of music professionals. Yet all three have personally witnessed the dramatic transformation of Taiwan\u2019s music industry, from the era of record labels dominating the scene to the rise of self-media.Nurturing Creative Skills Means Understanding the MarketAll three recall the 1990s as the golden era of record labels, when the music industry was clearly divided among professions such as record companies and talent agencies. Songwriting and composition were often honed through an apprenticeship model, where newcomers not only refined their craft but also came to understand the gap between their work and market demands. Many songs never made it past the multiple layers of review and were eliminated before release. At the time, the industry could only manage a little more than 300 album releases per year. Today, with the proliferation of digital streaming platforms, countless new songs are released daily, making competition even more intense. On the surface, anyone can become a creator, as entry barriers have lowered. But while talent is more visible, it is also more easily lost in the crowd. Once a creator finishes a piece, it goes directly online for the public to judge, facing the pressure of self-promotion and the anxiety of being overlooked.As creators now not only produce music but also manage and promote themselves, facing market evaluation on their own, the nature of \u201cmusic education\u201d has shifted. It is no longer just about developing technical skills; it now requires self-awareness, market understanding, and building long-term resilience. Ting, who has taught at community music academies more than thirty years ago, observed that in today\u2019s streaming environment, where similar music is constantly fed to listeners and creators are surrounded by echo chambers, many artists fall into familiar patterns, working on what they believe is \u201cgood\u201d without considering how to convey emotion to the public or resonate with listeners. In response, she encourages creators to start by producing work that resonates with the mainstream. Once they\u2019ve established a following and gained Teaching is absolutely worthwhile. Because I see hope; I believe these students will find their sense of purpose in this generation.Jamie Hsuehvisibility, they can then pivot toward creating the content they truly want to make.\u201cIn the record label era, things worked the same way: artists would wait until they became popular before making an album that truly expressed who they were,\u201d said Ting. \u201cThe market reflects what resonates with people, but these days it\u2019s often demonized, as if \u2018the market\u2019 automatically means something lowbrow. But making something accessible and widely appealing is actually really hard to do.\u201dWu, who frequently mentors up-and-coming lyricists through programs and workshops, adds that to truly understand where you stand as a creator, you need to listen widely. He often encourages young lyricists to imagine themselves as Golden Melody Awards judges, listening to every album released in Taiwan that year. \u201cMap out the musical landscape in your head. Figure out where you fit, what makes you distinct. That\u2019s how you really come to see your strengths and weaknesses.\u201dApart from writing songs and playing in a band, understanding the ins and outs of the industry is just as importantWanting to make music has never been only about \u201ccreating.\u201d It also requires long-term learning and accumulation in areas like legal knowledge, copyright transactions, and behindthe-scenes industry skills. Ting suggests that different university departments think about how their fields can connect with the music industry. For example, law departments could teach copyright protection, while international 128129","Sense & Sound: Five Ways into Taiwanese Pop MusicMake a Sound into the Futurebusiness departments could train students in global copyright transactions. These collaborations could help build a healthier and more resilient structure for the music industry. Hsueh, who has led the Pop Music program at Taipei City University of Science and Technology for twelve years, shares this view. He explains that music-related university courses have never been only about creation; they also include training connected to different parts of the industry. That said, most students still focus mainly on learning instruments or playing in bands. In his view, how students lay a strong foundation during college, both in creative work and in skills beyond creation is crucial for those hoping to pursue a career in music.Music education doesn\u2019t start in college; it should begin much earlierHsueh emphasizes that true music education shouldn\u2019t wait until university. Students should begin developing these skills naturally through everyday life, such as in middle school and high school. Ting also shares her experience working with the Ministry of Culture to develop supplementary teaching materials for elementary through high school, as well as training seed teachers. After all, it\u2019s only by starting with education and integrating music into more children\u2019s daily lives that we can nurture musicians ready to face the changing times.Despite the uncertainty in today\u2019s environment, all three seasoned professionals remain hopeful. Hsueh reflects, \u201cI keep meeting outstanding students, ones who possess strong behind-the-scenes skills, clarity of thought, and remarkable planning abilities. So I still believe teaching is absolutely worthwhile. Because I see hope; I believe these students will find their sense of purpose in this generation.\u201d\u201cAs long as there\u2019s someone willing to learn, we\u2019re willing to share everything we know. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll see the future of pop music and all its possibilities.\u201d says Ting.Though the digital age brings constant change and uncertainty, the steady support of veteran music professionals continues to nourish the next generation of creators. Today, it\u2019s easier than ever to begin making music, but harder than ever to persevere. That\u2019s where the true value of education lies: not just in helping young musicians write a song, but in equipping them with a broader view of the world and the ability to engage in dialogue with themselves. This isn\u2019t just the foundation of the music industry; it\u2019s what determines whether a creator can continue to speak through their work.
